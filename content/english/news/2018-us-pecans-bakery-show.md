<p>Bakery China 2018 was held from May 9 to 12 and occupied the 17 halls of the Shanghai New International Expo Center (SNIEC), plus four outdoor halls, covering over 4,000 m². The event featured thousands of brands from 2,100 global companies, attracting hundreds of thousands of professionals and visitors from over 100 countries and regions to learn, network, source, and trade the widest selection of bakery goods and products in China. Compared to SIAL China 2017, which occurred a week after Bakery China 2017, Bakery China had over 40,000 more visitors at 122,280 compared to SIAL’s 80,000 total visitors.</p>
<p>This was U.S Pecans’ first year having a standard booth at Bakery China in Shanghai. In addition to brochures and pecan kernel samples, we also invited a chef from a local bakery, who possessed experience developing pecan products, to develop 10 pecan products: pecan cinnamon rolls, pecan cream buns, pecan country bread, pecan Danish pastries, pecan Galette des Rois, pecan caramel tarts, pecan brownies, pecan pound cake, pecan cream cake, and pecan butter cookies. These products were not only for display, but also for tasting and sampling by visitors to the booth. Through direct exposure to pecans and pecan products, presented in a visually stimulating manner, more visitors were able to get a better idea as how to use pecans in baking. In addition, U.S. Pecans also purchased pecan tarts for tasting from Ichido Bakery Store. This pecan tart was the preferred product by many professional visitors to U.S. Pecans’ booth and inspired them to conduct R&D on pecan products at their own stores.</p>
<p>During the 4-day show, U.S. Pecans sent out approximately 800 copies of standard pecan brochures and received 250 business cards from professionals who visited the booth. Visitors came from major second-tier cities all over China, some of which have already started using pecans in their own products. Based on their feedback, we could gather that pecans are increasing in popularity across bakery sections in recent years. We also encouraged them to scan pecan QR codes to follow U.S. Pecans’ official website.</p>
<p>Bakery China is Asia Pacific's leading event serving the entire value chain for the bakery and confectionery market. Held in Shanghai annually, the event enables leading global professionals and buyer delegates to meet and share the latest innovations, trends, and discussions on manufacturing, distribution, R&D, applications, and related services for the bakery industry.</p>
