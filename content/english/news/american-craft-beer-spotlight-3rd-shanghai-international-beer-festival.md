<p>From 18-20 April 2014, Shanghai’s community of Chinese and expat beer enthusiasts and home brewers flocked to the Brewers Association’s (BA) American craft beer tent at the 3rd Shanghai International Beer Festival (SIBF).  </p>
<p>Featuring 45 beer styles from 13 U.S. craft breweries, the BA tent was one of the largest and most popular at the festival.  During the three-day event, large numbers of visitors were drawn into the tent by the myriad brews and colorful labels, most of which are unavailable in China.  In addition to the constant ebb and flow of new visitors, the BA tent also served as the festival’s meeting point for the newly launched China Home Brewers Association, whose members sampled and discussed nearly all 45 of the different American craft beers offered over the three days.  The tent also served as the festival’s primary hangout for Shanghai local craft beer bar owners and employees, as well as expats that were thrilled to once again have access to their favorite beers.  Throughout the event, BA China representatives were constantly asked “where can I get these beers in China?”  Although many visitors were disappointed to learn that most of the beers are not available in China, the wide variety and exclusivity of the beers on offer at the BA tent served to generate greater interest and demand for American craft beers.</p>
<p>In addition to hosting an American Craft Beer tent, BA’s Bob Pease traveled all the way from Boulder Colorado to attend the festival making his debut as Chief Operating Officer, and serving as a judge in the festival’s beer competition.</p>
<p>Shanghai International Beer Festival has grown rapidly since its launch in 2012 with the 3rd edition having hosted nearly 30,000 visitors, an increase of almost 7,000 from the previous year.  According to the event organizers, returning exhibitors noticed an increase in the number of Chinese visitors, many of which are demonstrating an increasing interest in foreign and locally brewed craft beers.  The success of the event is further demonstrated by the turnout of nearly 12,000 visitors who weathered rain and fog on the second day in order to not miss out on any of the festival.</p>
