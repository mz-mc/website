<p>From November 25 to December 25, a cranberry promotion was jointly held with the yogurt chain Hey_Yo, at its 29 outlets in various Southern China cities including Shenzhen, Dongguan, Guangzhou and Foshan. This promotion aimed at enhancing awareness of U.S. cranberries and their applications in the dessert restaurant and bakery sectors. </p>
<p>The theme of this promotion was “Enjoy Cranberry Life with Sweet Treats”. The promotion featured nine new cranberry products developed by Hey_Yo such as Red Velvet Cake with Cranberry, Cranberry Mousse Cake, Matcha & Chocolate Cake with Cranberry, and Cranberry Yogurt etc. Customers who activated Hey_Yo’s Wechat membership cards each got one RMB 5.0 coupon which they could use to buy any cranberry product.</p>
<p>During the promotion, the participating Hey_Yo outlets were decorated with U.S. Cranberry liveries including flags, posters and table-top tent cards. Special displays of cranberry products were also arranged while the video showing cranberries harvest was played continuously on the stores’ TV monitors. </p>
<p>The promotion was heavily advertised in Shenzhen, Hey_Yo’s stronghold. CMC poster ads appeared in 2 subway lines on the train carriage doors, windows, chairs and walls for one month. They showed CMC’s and Hey_Yo’s logos, and various cranberry products. According to official data provided by Shenzhen Metro, the potential total reach was 4.7 million (opportunity-to-see) during the advertising period. </p>

Additionally, CMC and Hey_Yo Wechat official accounts posted relevant contents about the promotion, receiving a total of 26,032 clicks. </p>
<p>To generate more mileage from this promotion, MZMC issued corresponding press release to influential media in Southern China.
