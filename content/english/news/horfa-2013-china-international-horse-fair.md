<p>From September 26-28, 2013, MZMC hosted a cranberry booth at the U.S. Food and Wine Pavilion of the Horfa trade show in Shanghai, China.  Horseback riding and equestrian activities are currently in the very early market development stage in China, and are generally geared toward only the most affluent consumers.  Similar to golf resorts, horse clubs in China typically include high-end dining and lodging facilities with imported food and wine offerings.  Among the visitors and exhibitors at Horfa were imported food and wine distributors, baking and kitchen equipment suppliers, as well as equestrian clubs, overseas real estate and investment specialists, and representatives from all aspects of the horse sales, care, and transportation industries.  The cranberry booth offered samples and provided product information during the 3 day show.</p>
