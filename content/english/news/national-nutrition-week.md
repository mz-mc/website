<p>From May 13 to 19, National Nutrition Week(NNW)was held by the Chinese Nutrition Society(CNS). This year, the slogan was ‘Balance diet and exercise to keep fit.’ Its aim was to promote a healthy and nutritious lifestyle by holding themed events targeted at different audiences across the country.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As the sponsor, CMC donated 50,000 cranberry sample packs, which were freely distributed at themed events in 6 second-tier and third-tier cities: Chongqing, Wuhan, Changsha, Hefei, Harbin, and Hohhot. Additionally, CMC invited a celebrity nutritionist to develop 3 low-calorie cranberry recipes, which were cranberry oatmeal, cranberry yoghurt, and cranberry rice cereal. These three recipes were subsequently added by CNS to its public healthy eating and dietary guidelines. CNS also published an advertorial entitled ‘How important is the balance of diet and exercise? Cranberries may help you!’ on Navigation for Nutrition, a specially tailored annual magazine for NNW with a controlled circulation of 2,000.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>NNW kicked off on May 13 at Beijing's Olympic Forest Park with an opening ceremony hosted by CNS. High level representatives and executives from CNS, National Health Commission, China Association for Science and Technology, and Beijing Municipal Bureau of Sports delivered speeches stressing that each person should be responsible for their own health. They also fired the starter’s pistol to signal the start of the 5-kilometer race, in which roughly 1,000 people from the government, trade associations, and other companies ran, jogged, or walked for health. Participants were also encouraged to bring along their friends and families to the park as spectators.</p>

<p>CMC set up a 9-square meter booth for promoting U.S. cranberries at the event, which was decorated with flags and posters prominently featuring vibrant images of cranberries<a name="_GoBack" id="_GoBack"></a>. Runners and spectators who scanned CMC’s QR code and became followers of CMC’s WeChat were presented with gift packs containing dried cranberries and recipe books. CMC’s logos appeared on the backdrop of the main stage and pillar and CMC’s name was published in NNW’s brochure and on CNS’s WeChat post.</p>

<p>Founded in 1945, CNS is a multi-disciplinary professional organization dedicated to research and the application of the best nutritional practices for the promotion of human well-being and the prevention of disease. Currently, CNS has over 18,000 members in 31 regional societies across China including academics, nutritionists, clinicians and dietitians, health workers, educators, and students.</p>
