With a theme of, ""loss reduction, refined management, and fewer trade disputes,"" participants praised the seminar as an informative event. It was held as part of China Green Week.</p>
<p>Ms. ZHOU Mi, Business Director of Cold Chain, Climate Technologies, Emerson Commercial and Residential Solutions, kicked things off with an introduction to Emerson's history and its blueprint for developing the Chinese market. Emerson consists of two business platforms: Automation Solutions and Commercial & Residential Solutions. In the 2017 fiscal year, this venerable Fortune 500 firm boasted global sales totaling $15.3 billion, of which 21% came from Asia. China, where Emerson has maintained a strong presence for decades, has since 2002 been the second largest market for the company, after the United States.</p>
<p>As for Emerson's motivation in venturing into cargo monitoring, Ivan Fullin, Director of Emerson Cargo Solutions–Asia, said food waste caused by complex supply chains has become a global problem. ""One billion metric tons of food is lost or wasted, never making it from farm to fork,"" he said. ""One third of food produced each year is never eaten. Over 800 million people are chronically hungry."" Emerson firmly believes that the situation can be much better if food is monitored during transportation. Driven by this mission, the company has launched a new business unit called Cargo Solutions which provides logging and tracking solutions for products that are moving through the cold chain.</p>
<p>Also invited to deliver speeches onstage, sharing their insights into the impact of temperature fluctuation on fruit quality were: Ms. Mabel Zhuang, Editor-in-Chief of Produce Report; Mr. Kurt Huang, General Manager of Shanghai Oheng Import and Export Company; Ms. HU Ping, General Manger–China of Fiesta Foods Mexico; Mr. HU Xian, General Manager of Shanghai Airipening Agriculture Technology Company; and Mr. Saw Tiang-Aik, Sales Manager, Emerson Commercial and Residential Solutions, Asia Pacific.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr. YU Hailin, Account Manager, Cargo Solutions, Emerson Commercial and Residential Solutions, elaborated on the significance of monitoring cargo temperature from harvest to the final consumer and how Emerson's GO line of loggers and trackers help to guarantee unbroken cold chain distribution.</p>
<p>A highlight of the seminar was two case studies of how real customers used Emerson solutions to identify and correct temperature issues during shipping. For example, overland shipping from Kashgar, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to Guangzhou, Guangdong Province is one of the longest and most complex transit lines in China. Such a long distance of over 5,000 kilometers often results in quality problems for fresh fruit. One shipper found drastic temperature swings along the leg from Xinjiang to Xi'an after receiving alerts delivered by a GO tracker, which monitors the real-time location and temperature of goods in transit. The shipper settled the matter in no time after making a call to the driver, who had turned off the truck's refrigeration unit on the road.</p>
<p>In addition to ensuring food safety, Emerson's monitoring solutions also help customers access and interpret data to make good decisions. Thanks to the outstanding performance of Emerson trackers, beyond finding a temperature abnormality in real time via mobile phone, another shipper even finished the ripening process in-transit. In a shipment of jackfruit from Vietnam to Shanghai, the shipper noted low ripeness levels after the first stage of the journey. In the second leg of shipment, the in-transit temperature was elevated to 16℃ with the intention to accelerate the ripening process. Upon arrival, most of the jackfruits were well-ripened—featuring strong fragrance, sweet taste, and crisp texture.</p>
<p>As a company always focusing on real scenarios in the produce industry and relying on innovation to gain a cutting edge, Emerson has recently launched three new products based on market demand, including:</p>
<p>① GO Real-Time CO₂ Tracker: Monitoring levels of CO₂ and providing real-time alerts as shipments of fresh produce moves through the supply chain</p>
<p>② GO Real-Time Secure Tracker: Using real-time GPS tracking technology to mitigate cargo theft and financial loss</p>
<p>③ GO Real-Time Flex: A multifunctional real-time tracker which monitors a wider range of parameters such as pulp temperature, ambient temperature, location, light, and humidity<br />

This was followed by Dr. Yi Gong, the consultant for CMC, who delivered a presentation on “The Features and Innovative Applications of Cranberry Juice & Concentrate.” Dr. Gong began with the question ‘Why do we need cranberries?’ to which he followed up with 4 key reasons people use cranberries: they possess the characteristics of a consumer keen to consume cranberries, the myriad of health benefits associated with using cranberries, cranberries’ ability to be processed and retain their flavor and healthy characteristics, and cranberries’ wide application in various beverages. He also highlighted the various forms and applications of different cranberry products, including dried cranberries, cranberry concentrate, cranberry powder, and cranberry puree. The attendees showed great interest in cranberries and were keen to know more during the Q&A session. Eddy Yang, the master mixologist, also shared his ideas on how to use cranberries in drinks for each meal of the day, exploring cranberry-based beverages for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Video demonstrations of the three drinks played onsite, and after tasting the prepared beverages, attendees spoke highly of them and some even said that they were inspired by the drinks. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>34 attendees completed post-seminar questionnaires, in which 100% of respondents stated that the cranberry presentation helped them to increase their technical knowledge of cranberries. 71% responded that they were considering adopting key training recommendations and using U.S. cranberry juice and concentrate.</p>

<p>He explained to a packed room of more than 220 fruit industry leaders from around the world that he recently has been spending effort seeking out varieties of fruit with counterintuitive characteristics such as low yield, and difficulty of transport. The payoff for a lot of time and energy pursuing products which will often ultimately not be viable? Occasionally he is able to bring to his shops a product which is, ""new, unique and tasty,"" and for which consumers in China, who increasingly crave high quality and unique experiences, will pay a premium.</p>
<p><em>""As an overall China policy, the government is trying to increase the imports of fresh produce long-term, so that's really good news for international producers,""</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The opportunity to walk away with these sorts of insights into the complex and fast-changing China fresh fruit market is a major draw for <em>Fresh Connections: China</em>, which features a full day of speakers, panel discussions and networking breaks, and has almost doubled in attendance since its inception. Traditionally held in Shanghai, <em>Fresh Connections: China</em> was this year held for the first time in Shenzhen.</p>
<p>""We really focus on quality, which means having great speakers, spending a lot of time researching topics, and making sure it's a good experience for the participants,"" says Richard Owen, PMA Vice President for Global Membership and Engagement, speaking about how the education-focused event, which is PMA's flagship event in Asia, has become a top draw for premium international suppliers  and top Chinese importers, distributors, retailers and ecommerce companies. ""Our aim is that they can walk away not only with connections to other key players, but also in-depth knowledge.""</p>
<p>The 2018 edition of <em>Fresh Connections: China </em>was opened by Cathy Burns, CEO of PMA with a ""State of the Industry"" overview and capped with the excellent ""Thinking like a Global CEO"" panel, moderated by Burns and featuring The Giumarra Companies President Tim Riley, Mission Produce President Steve Barnard, Sun World Executive Vice President David Marguleas, and Nature's Pride Commercial Director Adrielle Dankier.</p>
<p>Following are a few of the topics that came up repeatedly over the course of the 2018 <em>Fresh Connections: China</em> conference.</p>
<p>TECHNOLOGY, TECHNOLOGY, TECHNOLOGY</p>
<p>As the fresh produce industry integrates new technologies throughout the supply chain, China has emerged as a leader in some key areas, especially technologies that reduce friction points for the consumer such as mobile payments (with an estimated 94% penetration rate in first tier cities), app-based food delivery and, a big buzzword in China right now, ""O2O,"" or online-to-offline—which describes a range of technologies and strategies for using internet-based tools to facilitate brick-and-mortar sales, and vice versa.</p>
<p>""In the past the retailer didn't know who is buying, but now with O2O all the data will be stored by the company, and the company can drive the offline retail business,"" said Mike Li, Procurement Director for fresh fruits and vegetables at JD Fresh, an arm of Chinese ecommerce giant JD.com.</p>
<p>A trend that received a lot of attention at this year's <em>Fresh Connections: China </em>are the large investments by Chinese tech firms such as JD, Alibaba Group and Tencent into many areas of the fresh produce and retail industries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mike Li spoke as part of a panel discussion, ""The Future of Retail and E-tail in China,"" alongside Eric Li, Vice President for Global Sourcing and Alliance of Yiguo.com, which bills itself as China's first fresh food ecommerce company. Last year, the company received $300 million of funding from Alibaba Group. In addition to its original fresh fruit e-commerce platform, Yiguo Group now operates cold logistics and procurement/supply chain divisions.</p>
<p>With so much investment, M&A activity, strategic cooperation, expansion into new industry segments, and other business activity affecting the fresh industry in China, the detailed explanations and organizational charts presented by speakers at <em>Fresh Connections: China</em> allowed international participants to get a firmer grasp on the major industry players, industry structure, and new developments—especially in relation to the technology companies.</p>
<p>Of course, as a summit of global leaders in the fresh produce industry, discussions of technology were not limited to what's happening in China. Ed Treacy, PMA Vice President for Supply Chain Efficiencies and Dan Sun, President of HarvestMark (China) presented ""Exploring the Power of Blockchain Technology,"" with a concise overview of blockchain technology and update on how it is being trialed and applied in the fresh produce industry.</p>
<p>Treacy also highlighted to the many PMA members in the audience how the organization is participating in some of the pilot blockchain projects being run by IBM in partnership with a broad spectrum of companies, including Walmart, Wegmans, Kroger, Dole and Driscoll's. He said that PMA's goals included making sure that blockchain solutions produced by IBM won't require suppliers to completely overhaul their existing systems and business standards, and that they will be accessible and implementable by businesses of all types and sizes, not just the major industry players with large IT budgets. ""We want to be a voice in helping industry figure stuff like this out,"" said Treacy.</p>
<p>RISING FRUIT IMPORTS AND CHALLENGES FOR CHINA'S DOMESTIC FRUIT INDUSTRY</p>
<p>""As an overall China policy, the government is trying to increase the imports of fresh produce long-term, so that's really good news for international producers,"" said Eric Li of Yiguo.com. During an extensive domestic market overview, China Fruit Marketing Association President Lu Fangxiao also noted that since 2010, when China was exporting more fruit than it was importing, imports and exports became roughly equal for several years, and now China is importing more fresh fruit that is it exporting, both by volume and value. ""Chinese fruit’s price advantage in export markets has weakened, and domestic consumers' demand for premium and safe fruit from outside China has grown,"" said Lu.</p>
<p>Several speakers pointed out that the Chinese fruit industry has found itself structurally misaligned with market demands. China is producing large volumes of commodity-grade fruits and fruit varieties that have traditionally been popular in China—for example apples, bananas and melons. But consumption patterns have shifted, with consumers placing more emphasis on higher quality and unique experiences. Consumers do not necessarily prefer imported products over domestically produced products every time, it is just that imports are currently better positioned to match consumer preferences at the premium end of the market.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is all good news for international suppliers of imported fruit, at least in the short term. Longer term, the picture may be more complex. ""I believe there will be increased demand for higher end imported fruits,"" noted Mau Wah Liu, Chairman of Joy Wing Mau Group. ""However, they may face challenges from some high quality domestic competitors."" As examples of Chinese producers starting to realign production to match changing demands of domestic customers he cited progress in domestic kiwifruit breeding and production, branded citrus like Chu oranges, table grapes, and increasing domestic production of blueberries and raspberries, which were historically not grown in commercial quantities in China.</p>
<p>He also noted that as market access to China accelerates, international suppliers of some fruits, such as apples, may find themselves facing more competition from other imports from different regions.</p>
<p>Overall, both Lu and Liu predicted that rising standards of living and changing consumer trends are setting up China's fruit market for a ""golden era"" of growth and development over the next decade—with bright opportunities for both international and domestic producers who can overcome key challenges and adapt to consumers' demand for differentiated and high-quality fruit. ""If you have good products, price is not a problem,"" said Liu ""The middle class is willing to play a premium price for premium quality products.""</p>
<p>LOCAL PRODUCTION AND BRAND-BUILDING</p>
<p>A greater number of international producers have seen the virtue of moving production inside of China, where they can be closer to the end consumer and avoid the challenges of import and quarantine inspection.</p>
<p>One such company is Driscoll's, which now produces blueberries and raspberries in China's Yunnan province.</p>
<p>According to Jae Chun, Vice President and General Manager of Asia Pacific for Driscoll's (China), at the end of the day consumers simply, ""want a better berry, and that's something we think we can bring to the Chinese market by producing locally.""</p>
<p>As an example of the success that Driscoll's has seen with its domestic production, Chun showed photos of imported Driscoll's blueberries and Yunnan, China-produced Driscoll's blueberries being sold by a retailer on the same shelf, but at different times. The China produced Driscoll's berries were being sold at three times the price. ""To be honest, speaking for myself, I was quite surprised,"" said Chun. ""I didn't expect that.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But for most companies, getting production going in China will mostly likely involve a steep learning curve, a lot of patience, and what Chun termed, ""fast learning and the ability to adapt."" According to Chun, ""it took us almost three years from first breaking ground to having a product that we thought was worthy of putting our brand on and selling into the market.""</p>
<p>A frequent topic during the event was the advantage of having a strong brand in the Chinese market, and how much more work still needs to be done by the fruit industry on building up strong fruit brands in China. One positive on this front was learning more about Mr. Avocado, a Chinese joint venture from Mission Produce, Lantao and Pagoda. Though Mr. Avocado is using imported avocados supplied by Mission, it is a leader in avocado ripening in China, and has therefore been able to supply local consumers with a very consistent and quality avocado while simultaneously building up a brand that is tailored to resonate with local consumers. This edition of <em>Fresh Connections: China</em> was also host to the signing ceremony among Mission, Lantao and Pagoda for a new ripening center that will be constructed to cover southern China.</p>
<p>Another smart branding concept in the exploding China avocado market was on display at the Shanghai Supafresh sponsor table. Its Bravocado brand is a three-pack of avocados, one labeled with a sticker showing it is 30% ripe, another 60% and another 90%. This allows consumers in China to skip the guesswork, grab a pack, and then consume it over the course of several days as each fruit ripens.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ATTENDEES' REACTION</p>
<p>About half of the delegates chose to participate in optional events on Tuesday, including an afternoon firsthand tour of upscale 'new retail' supermarket concepts from Alibaba group with its Hema brand and Yonghui with its Super Species brand, as well as a visit to one of China's more than 2,000 Pagoda retail fruit shops.</p>
<p>Raul Romero, President and COO of Chestnut Hill Farms, a producer of Costa Rican pineapples, chose to attend both the retail tour and the full-day conference. Chestnut Hill Farms shipped a small amount of pineapple to China last year after Costa Rican pineapples gained market access. He and the company's Director of International Sales Adriana Garcia this year chose to travel to mainland China for the first time to explore further opportunities here, and to make <em>Fresh Connections: China</em> part of the process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>""We've been members of PMA for many years, and we've seen how effective their venues are,"" says Romero, who has been a longtime exhibitor at PMA Fresh Summit in the US. ""I think that we got a good glance at the quality expectations that the market is looking for, and is willing to pay for, as long as the product meets those expectations."" Romero also said that the event was an effective way to learn about, ""how the market is structured, and how advanced it is in certain aspects—more so than some of the other markets we are currently in—especially in terms of online ordering and home delivery. Very impressive.""</p>
<p>The presence of attendees like Chestnut Hill Farms matches an overall trend observed by PMA's Richard Owen. ""Among the international attendees this year, we're seeing people from more different places, and people that are more ready to do business in both directions,"" says Owen. ""Chinese companies that are saying, 'we've done exploration, we're now looking for active partners,' and suppliers that are ready to find Chinese partners. A few years ago, people were only interested to learn about the market. Now there's so many success stories that people are realizing if they wait much longer they're going to miss the opportunity.""</p>

 ","<p>From February 5th to 28th, U.S. Pecans launched restaurant promotions at 9 well-known restaurants, covering 11 stores in total. 28 Chinese dishes featuring pecan kernels were developed by the restaurants’ master chefs and were served during the promotional period, among which included appetizers, dim-sums, main dishes, desserts, drinks, and ice cream. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In order to instruct chefs on the proper uses for pecan kernels, 9 chefs along with restaurant purchasers were educated and underwent training at the Metro Catering Academy, where U.S. Pecans had also held a recipe development seminar last August. </p>
<p>To better promote this event, each store prepared displays of POP materials, such as customized menus, posters, tent cards, etc. These POP materials contained basic information about U.S. pecans as well as photos of the promoted pecan dishes. In addition, U.S. Pecans also invited an active social media KOL (key opinion leader), who had 150,000 WeChat followers and 220,000 Weibo followers, to post one piece of content on each platform. By the end of the restaurant promotion, these two postings received more than 90,000 pageviews and 44 likes.</p>
<p>During the promotion, each restaurant offered an average of 3 dishes which featured pecan kernels and by the end of promotion, 5,805 dishes were sold in total. MZMC staff visited participating store locations, tasted some of the pecan dishes, and received feedback from the chefs about the promotion and pecans in general. Overall, it was noted that pecans possessed a much better flavor than walnuts and proved to be quite adaptable to Chinese cuisine. A chef from the Jade Pavilion, one of the restaurants in the promotion, remarked that pecans could prove a good replacement for hickory and would be an ideal topping for ice cream. Tyler Babcock, Deputy Director of ATO Shanghai, attended a CMC media event at the Moller Villa, which also participated in the pecan promotion. Pecan Beefsteaks, Pecan Scallops, and Pecan Tarts with Panna Cotta were served at the event to 27 members of the media.</p>
<p>Following the promotion, four restaurants listed as below keep at least one pecan dish on their regular menu for at least one season. These restaurants and dishes included:</p>
<p>•       Pecan and Black Rice Juice at Jiu Chu Tang</p>
<p>•       Pecan Salad at Moller Villa</p>
<p>•       Pecan Corn Cake at The Gusto!</p>
<p>•       Caramel Pudding with Pecan Pieces, Pecan and Pineapple Salad, and Roasted Banana with Pecan at Eat More Fish</p>

<p>2018 was U.S. Pecan’s sixth year of hosting a booth at the annual SIAL China trade show. This year, U.S. Pecans reduced the size of the booth, participating in a joint booth with U.S. Cranberries, and instead focused more on promoting pecans kernels to the Chinese market. We also encouraged visitors to scan pecan QR codes, which would lead them to U.S. Pecans’ official WeChat group and increase U.S. Pecans’ WeChat follower count. Over the course of the three-day trade show, the number of followers on U.S. Pecans’ WeChat increased by over 1,000. Staff at the U.S. Pecans booth went great lengths to introduce pecans to visitors, offering them various pecan samples and providing them with a valuable pecan suppliers list. Ichido pecan tarts were also purchased for tasting and sampling for visitors at the show.</p>
<p>On the second day of the show, U.S. Pecans and U.S. Cranberries invited the popular food Key Opinion Leader (KOL) “Momo” to perform livestreamed cooking demonstrations. “MoMo” is a famous food blogger who promotes a healthy and fashionable lifestyle and has over 640,000+ followers on Weibo and 100,000+ followers on WeChat. She has collaborated with many renowned associations and brands in promotion of their products, such as the German National Tourist Board, Conseil Interprofessionnel du Vin de Bordeaux, Starbucks, and Siemens. She is a columnist and has published her own book. During the livestream, Momo prepared two pecan recipes, a pecan salad and pecan brownie cake. The livestream of this event received 6 million views, which can be viewed at<br /><a href=""https://www.yizhibo.com/l/eYvoPApSc2obhMVA.html"">https://www.yizhibo.com/l/eYvoPApSc2obhMVA.html</a>.</p>
<p>This year, because of the concern surrounding the issue of tariffs between China and the U.S., pecan traders, retailers, and online marketers voiced some concerns as to purchasing pecans from the United States or domestically. However, these trade and industry visitors had the opportunity to speak directly to some U.S. pecan growers to get more information, as Cater Pecan, Hudson Pecan, Green Valley Pecan, Wharton Ranch, Front Porch Pecans, and others all had their own booths at SIAL.</p>
<p>2018 marked SIAL China’s 19th year of operation. This year, a record 110,000 trade visitors and 3,400 exhibitors attended the trade show. Approximately 1,200 copies of U.S. Pecans brochures and other pecan gifts were distributed at the event, with the contact information of more than 200 visitors being collected in total.</p>

Compared to SIAL China 2017, which occurred a week after Bakery China 2017, Bakery China had over 40,000 more visitors at 122,280 compared to SIAL’s 80,000 total visitors.</p>
<p>This was U.S Pecans’ first year having a standard booth at Bakery China in Shanghai. In addition to brochures and pecan kernel samples, we also invited a chef from a local bakery, who possessed experience developing pecan products, to develop 10 pecan products: pecan cinnamon rolls, pecan cream buns, pecan country bread, pecan Danish pastries, pecan Galette des Rois, pecan caramel tarts, pecan brownies, pecan pound cake, pecan cream cake, and pecan butter cookies. These products were not only for display, but also for tasting and sampling by visitors to the booth. Through direct exposure to pecans and pecan products, presented in a visually stimulating manner, more visitors were able to get a better idea as how to use pecans in baking. In addition, U.S. Pecans also purchased pecan tarts for tasting from Ichido Bakery Store. This pecan tart was the preferred product by many professional visitors to U.S. Pecans’ booth and inspired them to conduct R&D on pecan products at their own stores.</p>
<p>During the 4-day show, U.S. Pecans sent out approximately 800 copies of standard pecan brochures and received 250 business cards from professionals who visited the booth. Visitors came from major second-tier cities all over China, some of which have already started using pecans in their own products. Based on their feedback, we could gather that pecans are increasing in popularity across bakery sections in recent years. We also encouraged them to scan pecan QR codes to follow U.S. Pecans’ official website.</p>
<p>Bakery China is Asia Pacific's leading event serving the entire value chain for the bakery and confectionery market. Held in Shanghai annually, the event enables leading global professionals and buyer delegates to meet and share the latest innovations, trends, and discussions on manufacturing, distribution, R&D, applications, and related services for the bakery industry.</p>

This was the fifth such conference to be held in Shanghai, following successful events over the past four years. Around 200 Chinese and overseas importers, exporters, growers, e-commerce owners, and business consulting firms have participated in the event.","<p>The annual business network conference, PMA Fresh Connections: China, opened on March 16 at the Westin Bund Hotel. This was the fifth such conference to be held in Shanghai, following successful events over the past four years. Around 200 Chinese and overseas importers, exporters, growers, e-commerce owners, and business consulting firms have participated in the event.</p>
<p>At the opening ceremony, Richard Owen, Vice President of Global Business Development at PMA US, announced, “As a global trade organization for the fresh produce industry, PMA brings together some of the top supply-chain executives, industry experts, and leaders from around the world. Our efforts in global connections are long-term investment and commitment and your feedback is welcome.”</p>
<p>With the improvement of living standards over recent years, China has become a huge and lucrative consumer market and access to this dynamic global fresh produce marketplace symbolizes success.</p>
<p>Jason Hafemeister, Acting Deputy Undersecretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Affairs at the US Department of Agriculture, could not agree more: “The US shows great interest in China as its trading partner. Despite the fact that producers in the fruit and vegetable sectors need to overcome barriers to find partners, China remains a priority for us as its trade partner.”</p>
<p>As well as being a major importer, the US is a large producer and exporter in the produce industry, since there is great interest in US-produced fruits and vegetables due to their high quality and safety standards. Last year, American strawberries were finally approved to enter the Chinese market for the first time after ten years of effort. According to Mr. Hafemeister, “We are committed to long-term success.”</p>
<p>Apart from the US, representatives from Chile and Australia all expressed their ongoing interest in the Chinese market. As Cesar Suarez, Trade Commissioner at the Commercial Office of Chile in Shanghai, pointed out, Chile is a Southern Hemisphere country that is geographically opposite China and enjoys a natural environment that serves as a natural screen and provides protection against plant diseases and pests. Furthermore, many varieties of Chilean fruits have benefited from zero tariffs over the last 12 years under the free-trade agreement (FTA) with China. All of these factors helped Chile to become the #1 exporter of fruits to China in 2016.</p>
<p>Mr. Suarez explained how Chile is carrying out more marketing activities in China, enhancing its e-commerce capacity, and enlarging its network by attending trade fairs, seminars, and conferences.</p>
<p>Similar to the natural geographical advantages mentioned by Mr. Suarez, Brent Moore, Trade Commissioner and Commercial Consul at the Australian Consulate-General in Shanghai, described how Australia, another Southern Hemisphere country, also enjoys good climate and weather, a counter-seasonal advantage, and an FTA with China. He also told attendees how Australian fruit has been welcomed on the Chinese market as a result of its high quality, such as Tasmanian cherries, which were exported to China around the Chinese Lunar New Year period and achieved sales of 8,600 tons on Tmall alone. Finally, he shared his optimism for the Chinese market and explained how Australia intends to export more apricots, avocados, kiwifruits, and other produce to China and hopes that more fresh products will be consumed quicker in Chinese cities in the future.</p>
<p>In 2016, China imported 3.6 million tons of fruit and fruit exports hit 3.92 million tons, with a combined value of over 10 billion USD, just under those of the grain & oil, meat sectors. With a huge market potential and preferential trade policies, the fruit trade will help to support the domestic supply to meet consumer demand, according to Chao Junwen, General Secretary, China Chamber of Commerce of Import&Export of Fruit-CFNA.</p>
<p>He explained, “Founded in 1988, CFNA with its 7,000 member enterprises is committed to the development of agricultural products and the fruit branch of CFNA is committed to coordination, guidance, and promotion of the sector. This is our first cooperation with PMA to jointly promote the healthy development of the sector via this exchange platform. We look forward to more in-depth cooperation and the development of more business opportunities.”</p>
<p>PMA Chinese market development representative Mabel Zhuang was next to introduce the general situation of the Chinese market. She discussed the status quo of imports in the fresh produce market, the predicted future trends in the industry, and her insights into changes in China’s fresh food trade structure, considering a combination of domestic production, trade statistics, new marketing channels, and other data.</p>
<p>During the day, speeches and panel discussions were categorized into six themed sessions to allow participants to enjoy opportunities such as learning about the most in-demand products and discovering new sources for those products, gaining strategic advice from industry leaders on growing their business, and exploring new technologies to improve product development and food safety initiatives.</p>

<p>CMC attended the event in an attempt to assess the potential value of putting in certain investment to sponsor a talk or hold a booth at the next summit.</p>
<p>Organizer</p>
<p>Fruit and Vegetable Beverage Commission in cooperation with Beverage Industry Publishing House, under the auspices of its supervising body, the China Beverage Industry Association.</p>
<p>Theme & Structure of the Summit</p>
<p>The theme of this summit was “More Nutritious, More Diversified – The Blue Ocean of Fruit Juices”. The day-long event was divided into three parts: </p>
<p>1.	Presentation on General Topics – reports by the association on work done since the last meeting, and market trends, as well as reports by selective companies of their recent developments<br />
2.	Special Topic I – NFC Juice<br />
3.	Special Topic II – Fermented Fruit and Vegetable Juice </p>
<p>Part 2 and 3 are carried simultaneously in separate rooms. Attendees chose the topics according to their own or their companies’ special interest and needs</p>
<p>Note: CMC did not participate in the factory visits in Suzhou after the summit.</p>
<p>Evaluation and Recommendations</p>
<p>Total number of attendees exceeded 300, representing 141 different beverage manufacturers and their suppliers, among them were some big name companies including Huiyuan Juice Group, Tetra Pak China, Krunes AG, and Capri-sun<br />
The event’s pulling power comes from:<br />
History and background of the China Beverage Industry Association which has recruited many international and domestic major players (incl. Coca Cola, Weichuan, Nongfu Spring etc) as members over the years<br />
Networking opportunities for industry players due to the above<br />
Popular topic foci – NFC and fermented juices are both potential growth areas for the maturing juice industry in China</p>
<p>Value of participating in future summits</p>
<p>Sponsoring a talk and setting up a booth at the venue (optional) would certain enhance awareness of cranberry juice and frozen cranberries among the major fruit juice manufacturers in the country and raise their interest in considering using cranberry juice for their new products<br />
Getting winning new products is an important source of growth for most packaged foods companies as the market is getting mature<br />
The key success factor is to have systematic follow through actions:<br />
Obtaining name cards of the attendees and sending samples to those who express interest in cranberry products are not good enough<br />
CMC should work out a market development plan with cranberry juice importers who are interested in penetrating the juice manufacturing industry, and<br />
CMC should organize joint sales calls with such importers, visiting major manufacturers in the country</p>

","<p>On August 25 and 26, Shanghai Ringier Conference & Exhibition Co. Ltd. and Ringier Trade Media Ltd. organized the 2016 Functional Beverage and Nutritious Food Summit at the Westin Hotel in Guangzhou. </p>
<p>CMC participated in this event by delivering a 30-minute presentation on cranberry’s potential application in functional beverages. The presentation reported findings by Innova Market Insight and Mintel which showed the increasing use of natural fruit juices as functional beverages in Europe and the US. The main content, however, focused on the health benefits of consuming cranberry juice, drawing mostly on Dr. Amy Howell’s previous presentation. In addition, a 10-minute brief introduction presentation on US Cranberry was given during tea break. Throughout the two-day event, CMC had a small booth, outside the main conference hall, with backdrop and product display, among about a dozen other participants’ booths. US Cranberry product samples and information flyers were distributed to visitors. </p>
<p>2016 was the 7th time for Ringier to organize this annual event. It attracted about 240 attendees most of whom were working in functional beverages, nutritional food ingredients and health supplements. Because of the nature of the industry, representatives from smaller, tech-driven companies formed the major part of the audience.  Two dozen industry experts delivered a total of 28 presentations covering such topics as: </p>
<p>	Using collagen in food and beverage – their nutritional benefits and marketing values<br />
	Polypeptide from walnuts – their applications<br />
	Phenols in cereals and their health benefits<br />
	Global trends in food and beverage packaging<br />
	Market outlook for nutritious food in Taiwan<br />
	Market trend and challenges for food ingredients in Indonesia<br />
	Vegetable protein drinks’ market analysis by the research agency Mintel</p>
<p>Participation in this summit helped enhance the awareness of and liking for US Cranberry among food manufacturers, particularly those in the fast growing health food industry. Many attendees indicated that they had not been aware of the many health benefits of cranberries before listening to the CMC presentations. Several requests for samples were received during the two-day event, including one for cranberry powder by a techno-driven product development company and one for dried cranberries from the big snack foods group – Want-Want (a Taiwanese invested enterprise in Shanghai).</p>

The campaign will provide a fresh first look at the Australian oranges of this season and the opportunity for attendees to taste the superb specially made orange drinks, dishes, and desserts.</p>
<p>Attendees at the 2015 Australian Orange Media Campaign will be greeted by Mr. Tim Dillon, Commissioner at the Victorian State Government of Australia – China. Mr. Dillon’s introduction of sweet, safe, and healthy Australian oranges will be followed by remarks from Kang Yang Lim, chairman of Taste & See, encouraging customers to integrate Australian oranges into their daily diet. Mr. Ryan Lau, head pastry chef at Taste & See and formerly dessert chef at the Regent Hotel Singapore, will present an orange feast where he will share various orange recipes with the guests.</p>
<p>Australian citrus fruits are renowned throughout the world for their excellent color, sweet flavor, and high standards of quality and cleanliness. They are also renowned for their rich vitamin C content – one Australian orange has almost twice the recommended daily intake. Furthermore, they are high in folic acid and ideal for pregnant women, with one orange providing 18% of the recommended daily intake of this vital nutrient. Besides eating fresh oranges, combining Australian citrus fruits into daily baking and cooking is also the perfect choice to add an extra zing to meals and refreshments, as well as increasing their nutritional value.</p>
<p>The Australian citrus received a warm welcome last year. Furthermore, with the signing of the China–Australia Free Trade Agreement, the tariff for Australian oranges will decline to zero over the next eight years, making the fruit more competitively priced in China.</p>
<p>According to Citrus Australia, an excellent growing season has produced a very sweet fruit this season. There was much less wind during the spring, leading to a much cleaner fruit this season, and the cold weather in June has produced a rich and attractive orange color. In addition, the delivery time from Australia is much shorter than that from South America or Africa, which results in a fresher product and taste. Altogether, this season’s Australian oranges will have the same high quality as usual, and perhaps be even sweeter, safer, and healthier.</p>
<p>When it comes to health and safety, Australian citrus gives a good guarantee. Australian orange farmers use a pest control system called integrated pest management (IPM). This includes the use of beneficial insects to control the pest insects, so that the application of pesticides can be minimized. The beneficial insects are reared in special factories and then supplied to the farmers to release onto their farms. The industry also has a pesticide-residue testing program, which is endorsed by Citrus Australia and the Australian Government. In 2015, 500 residue tests will be conducted on export consignments to ensure 100% compliance with the residue limits of China.</p>
<p>Australia shipped 820 containers of citrus fruits to China last year, the majority of which were delivered to Shanghai and Guangzhou, with smaller amounts going to Qingdao, Dalian, and Tianjin. Among them, mandarins and navel oranges from Australia are the most popular and renowned varieties with Chinese consumers, while Valencia oranges, lemons, red and white grapefruit, and limes are also widely planted in Australia.</p>
<p>The 2015 season for Australian oranges extends from July to November. The eastern coastal cities and Beijing will still be the main markets for Australian oranges, but this year the industry will also begin to focus on some of the major inland cities such as Chengdu and Chongqing. During the peak season through to August, various promotions and marketing campaigns will be launched all over China, both in local stores like Sam’s Club, Ito Yokado (Chengdu), Ole’, Natregro, and via online sites including Fruitday, Jiaguo and Dazzle Fruit to increase penetration into the hinterland and allow even more Chinese customers to fall for this fresh and delicious Australian fruit.</p>

The 2015 conference continued to build upon previous years’ successes with record attendance, sold-out sponsorships, government delegations from 8 countries, and attendees from 15 countries and regions.","<p>On 26 March 2015, more than 160 Chinese and international fresh produce industry leaders came together at the Westin Hotel in Shanghai to participate in the third annual PMA Fresh Connections China.  The 2015 conference continued to build upon previous years’ successes with record attendance, sold-out sponsorships, government delegations from 8 countries, and attendees from 15 countries and regions.</p>
<p>The global fresh produce industry is increasingly looking toward China as a market with tremendous demand, future growth potential, and some of the highest import prices in the world.  At the same time, a growing number of Chinese retailers, wholesalers, and logistics companies are directly importing from overseas suppliers, while striving to up their games in branding, marketing, packaging, and cold-chain delivery.  As a result, mainland China has become a hotbed of competition for trade shows and conferences targeting the fresh produce industry.  Since launching the first PMA Fresh Connections: China (FCC) in 2013, PMA has continued to raise the bar and set new standards as the premier industry education and networking event in mainland China.</p>
<p>This year, attendees were greeted with opening remarks by Mr. Julian Ventura, Mexican Ambassador to China, and Ms. Valerie Brown-Jones, Director of the USDA Agricultural Trade Office in Shanghai.  While the USA has been a major supplier of fresh fruits to China since the 1990s, Mexico has made a splash in the past two years as the first country to achieve market access to China for avocados in 2013, and most recently for raspberries and blackberries in late-2014.  Opening remarks were followed by an introduction to China’s market access approval process for fresh produce by Mr. Feng Chunguang, Chairman of the Animal and Plant Division, China Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Association.  Mr. Feng explained the approval process, and provided an update on the status of 10 different fruit products for which there are currently 63 applications pending.  In addition to these first three speakers, attendees had the chance to network with government representatives from China, USA, Mexico, Peru, Ecuador, Netherlands, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Following the market access session, PMA’s China Consultant, Mabel Zhuang, provided an overview of China’s imported fruit market highlighting key trade figures on countries and products that are leading in fruit exports to China by volume, value, and growth.  She also drew upon PMA China market intelligence reports to introduce several industry trends that are shaping the future of China’s fresh fruit trade including fresh e-commerce, free trade zones, and the changing structure of China’s fresh produce supply chain.  Focusing on the other side of the fresh produce trade, Mr. John Chapple of Hunter Food Services followed with an introduction to food safety issues and requirements that Chinese exporters need to understand in order to meet the standards of the U.S. FDA’s Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA).</p>
<p>After the morning networking break, the conference shifted its attention to one of the hottest topics for both Chinese and global attendees: ‘The Value of Branding to Reach Chinese Consumers.’  Attendees heard presentations from managers of the world’s leading high-end fruit brands including Naturipe, Driscoll’s, and Zespri; the leading fresh fruit specialty chain store in China, Pagoda; and global fresh produce grower/trader/packer, Giumarra.  This session captivated attendee attention and sparked a lively panel discussion with the presenters.  During the session Q&A, one of the most astute audience questions came from Mr. Neil Maffey of Sam’s Club China:</p>
<p>“Given that the vast majority of China’s wealth is currently held by approximately 5 percent of the population, and this trend will only intensify over the next several years, how do you create brands that target different market segments and not only these elite shoppers?”</p>
<p>Lisa Cork, a presenter in the next session, asked:</p>
<p>“What importance do you place on developing Chinese language brand names vs. maintaining a unified global brand name?”</p>
<p>Attendees next heard from two fresh produce packaging gurus in the session entitled ‘Instant Attraction: Why Packaging is your most Important Sales Tool.’  Lisa Cork, Owner of Fresh Produce Marketing Ltd. in New Zealand, shared her packaging development strategy which has won her marketing awards and achieved triple-digit growth for her clients.  Next, Jacques Coetzee of NNZ in the Netherlands followed with key insights on evidence-based packaging strategies that have allowed NNZ to achieve successes for dozens of clients on every continent throughout the globe.</p>
<p>With these branding and packaging insights fresh on attendee minds, the following session focused on the most rapidly emerging sales channel which is continuing to make headlines and provide new opportunities for fresh produce marketing: ‘China’s E-Commerce Market: A USD409 Billion Opportunity.’  Eric Li, VP of Global Sourcing at Yiguo.com, and Ping Mi, CEO at Yummy77.com, each delivered presentations on the rapid development of this sector, and the challenges and opportunities for fresh e-commerce.  They were then joined by Mr. Vincent Yeh, Senior Director/GMM Fresh at Walmart China, for a lively panel discussion on how e-commerce is changing fresh produce retail, and the response of major players in brick-and-mortar retail.  Unfortunately, there was not enough time in the day to answer all the audience questions, a few of which included:</p>
<p>“How interested are e-commerce companies in direct upstream investment in fruit production?”</p>
<p>“Many fresh fruits are handled with great care from packinghouse to e-commerce distribution center, but are then poorly handled during the last kilometer of delivery to the consumer.  What is the outlook for improving this situation?”</p>
<p>“What is the potential for fresh-cut produce in Chinese brick-and-mortar and e-commerce retail?”</p>
<p>The final session turned to the more fundamental, yet less immediately visible issue of the fresh produce supply chain and logistics.  Entitled ‘The Changing Structure of Fresh Produce Distribution in China,’ this session featured presentations by fresh logistics service and technology leaders from Robinson Fresh, Sensitech, and IFCO.  Attendees learned where are the key challenges and bottlenecks in China’s fresh produce supply chain, and management methods and technologies that can be implemented to improve food safety, logistics efficiency, and reduce waste.</p>
<p>Between each session, attendees had the chance to network around sponsor tables which included fresh berry tasting by Aneberries, lemon and oranges from Sunkist, and banana samples from Goodfarmer.  Other 2015 sponsors included Driscoll’s, Lantao/I Love Produce, Naturipe, Sensitech, Sunkist, Giumarra, NNZ, IFCO, and Produce Report.  At the evening reception, attendees enjoyed wine and hors d'oeuvres as they continued to make new connections and follow up on discussions started during earlier networking breaks.</p>
<p>The following morning, approximately 30 FCC attendees participated in a market tour to see firsthand how fresh produce enters into and is distributed in China.  The tour began with a visit to the Huizhan Imported Fruit Wholesale Market, the second largest market for imported fruits in China.  Next, attendees visited the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone to learn from local government officials and representatives from Esen Agro, a major fruit import service provider, how this unique new environment is shaping the future of China’s fruit trade.  For the last stop on the tour, attendees crossed the 20-mile Donghai Sea Bridge to visit the Yangshan Deep-Water Port, the busiest cargo port in the world through which approximately 70 percent of Shanghai’s imported fruit enters.</p>
<p>Based on the success of this year’s event, PMA has already begun planning for a scaled-up Fresh Connections: China 2016.  Richard Owen, PMA’s Vice President of Global Business Development, explains:</p>
<p>“We are thrilled at how quickly FCC has become the leading fresh produce event in China…” </p>

The three-city effort was coordinated by Ms. Mabel Zhuang and MZ Communications, the affiliated marketing group managing the U.S. Pecans efforts in China.</p>
<p>The first program was hosted by Betty’s Kitchen, an internationally-renown media publishing group with the central office located in Geneva, Switzerland.  The China affiliate hosted the nutritional seminars and pecan cooking demonstrations at the M-Plus Cafe in the heart of Beijing on Monday September 22, 2014.  The event began with an introduction and welcome by Mr. Bruce Zanin, Director of Beijing ATO.  Following his comments, a signing ceremony was held by Mr. Chen Xianbao, Chairman, and Madam Weng Yangyang, Vice-Chairman and Executive Secretary, of the Specialized Committee for Roasted Seeds and Nuts of China, National Food Industry Association.  The official signing finalized a joint agreement between the China Nut Roasters Association and the U.S. Pecan Industry on Quality and Grading Standards.  This agreement represents the first formal attempt to develop quality and marketing standards for the international trade of pecans between the U.S. pecan growers and the Chinese processors.</p>
<p>The signing ceremony was followed by general comments from Dr. Hudson relating to the U.S. pecan industry and then Dr. Pegg, who presented the “Clinical and Nutritional Value of Pecans in a Daily Diet”.  The presentations were well received by all the Chinese media present.  It is estimated that over 20 media groups including TV, radio, magazine, and newspaper were represented at the seminar.</p>
<p>On Wednesday September 24, 2014 the second seminar on the “Clinical and Nutritional Value of Pecans in a Daily Diet” was presented in Lin’an City, Zhejiang Province, China.  The conference was hosted at the Wonderland Hotel located on Green Mountain Lake in the suburbs of Lin’an City.  The most concentrated manufacturing of nuts and seeds in China is located in the proximity of Hangzhou, China (Lin’an) area.  The turnout for the presentations exceeded expectations!  Over 100 pecan roasters, government officials, and media representatives were in attendance.<br />
The Hangzhou session began with an official welcome and opening remarks by Mr. Xu Zhongwu, Chairman of the Lin’an Roasted Seeds and Nuts Association.  He warmly greeted all guests and participants to the seminar. Additional comments were made by Ms. Valerie Brown-Jones, newly appointed Director of the U.S. Agricultural Trade Office, Shanghai.  A comprehensive and hour-long presentation was then delivered by Dr. Ronald B. Pegg of The University of Georgia on the “Clinical and Nutritional Value of Pecans in a Daily Diet”.</p>
<p>Dr. Pegg highlighted the nutrients of pecans and recent findings on the role of pecan consumption related to the amelioration of chronic disease states, such as cardiovascular disease, inflammation, and certain types of cancer.  Following Dr. Pegg’s presentation, Dr. Randy Hudson, Vice President of the National Pecan Growers Council and a member of the Executive Board of U.S. Pecans, gave a talk on the production, marketing, and quality attributes of U.S. pecans.  Dr. Hudson spent considerable time over the course of his hour-long presentation discussing the components of grading and marketing pecans.  Emphasis was placed on describing the new set of standards and regulations recently established through a cooperative agreement on marketing pecans in China.  There was significant interest in establishing a mutual grading and standards process for the U.S./China pecan trade, and this was the impetus for developing these regulations.  Toward the end of his presentation, Dr. Hudson summarized his comments by expressing the necessity that all Chinese traders clearly understand what is meant by variety, count, and grade when purchasing U.S. pecans.  The conference was followed by a state dinner, hosted by government officials and the select committee for roasted seeds and nuts. </p>
<p>On Thursday September 24, 2014, Drs. Hudson and Pegg traveled to Guangzhou, China, to prepare for the third and final seminar series.  Upon arrival to the city, they were transported to Heshan, Guangdong, where they met with Mr. Lai Xiaojun of Old Urchin, a joint-venture Guangdong Senhe Nuts Food Co., Ltd.  Old Urchin processes and distributes pecans from its two factories in the Heshan region near Guangzhou.  An older factory covers an area of over 35,000 m2, while the newer nut processing facility has an area of over 41,000 m2.  Drs. Hudson and Pegg visited the newer plant and were greatly impressed by the layout, new modern equipment and the tree nut chemical/ microbiological quality control testing laboratories within the plant.<br />
On Friday September 26, 2014 the third and final pecan seminar series in China was presented in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province.  The seminar was hosted at the Sheraton Hotel, 208 Tianhe Road, Tianhe District in downtown Guangzhou.  A smaller crowd than that at Hangzhou attended, but again comprised a variety of parities interested in pecans; these included processors (e.g., roasters), buyers, government officials, and the media.  In all there were over 50 participants in attendance. </p>
<p>The Guangzhou session began with welcoming remarks by Ms. Melinda Meador from the Agricultural Trade Office (ATO) in Hong Kong. Ms. Annie Lai, a marketing specialist also of the ATO Hong Kong office, was in attendance.  Following this, Mr. Lai Xiaojun, Chairman of the Guangdong Southern Nuts Industry Association, gave the official welcome to the participants and speakers.  Unlike the previous two seminars, everyone had electronic headsets with direct translation from English to Chinese on channel 1 and translation from Chinese to English on channel 2.  This format was far superior to that in Hangzhou, as there was no significant delay between the speaker and the translation.  This resulted in the presentations flowing better and enhanced engagement with the audience.  Mr. Xiaojun thanked U.S. Pecans for coming to China and sponsoring the educational event.  A comprehensive, hour-long presentation was then delivered by Dr. Ronald B. Pegg of The University of Georgia on the “Clinical and Nutritional Value of Pecans in a Daily Diet”.  Dr. Pegg highlighted the nutrients of pecans and recent findings on the role of pecan consumption related to the amelioration of chronic disease states, such as cardiovascular disease, inflammation, and certain types of cancer.  With the direct translation format, Dr. Pegg was able to devote more time in explaining details of the studies discussed as well as breaking down some of the terminology into its fundamental components.  Following Dr. Pegg’s presentation, there was a lively discussion with the audience.  Some excellent questions were posed by some of the largest pecan buyers in China.  A coffee break then lasted for ~40 min. During this time, the participants networked with Drs. Hudson and Pegg as well as enjoyed a variety of pecan baked goods prepared by the hotel with the coffee and tea.  After this, Dr. Randy Hudson, Vice President of the National Pecan Growers Council and a member of the Executive Board of U.S. Pecans, gave a presentation on the production, marketing, and quality attributes of U.S. pecans.  Dr. Hudson spent considerable time over the course of his hour-long presentation discussing the components of grading and marketing pecans.  Emphasis was placed on describing the new set of standards and regulations recently established through a cooperative agreement on marketing pecans in China.  There was significant interest in establishing a mutual grading and standards process for the U.S./China pecan trade, and this was the impetus for developing these regulations. He also dealt with the importance of moisture control in nuts shipped in refrigerated containers to China during the summer season.  He discussed how the nuts needed to be “conditioned” so that once taken out of refrigeration they wouldn’t pick up significant quantities of moisture leading to deterioration of quality in the form of mold and rancidity development.  Toward the end of his presentation, Dr. Hudson summarized his comments by expressing the necessity that all Chinese traders clearly understand what is meant by variety, count, and grade when purchasing U.S. pecans.

<p>Jointly organized by the Australian Trade Commission in Shanghai and Citrus Australia, the event kicked off with a welcome speech by Brent Moore, Trade Commissioner of the Australian Consulate-General Commercial Section.  Mr. Moore described the evolution of Australia’s agricultural trade with China over the past 40-plus years, and explained that in recent years the China market has become increasingly important to Australia’s 1,800 citrus farms.</p>
<p>Mr. Moore’s remarks were followed by an introduction to Shanghai CIQ’s role in the Australian citrus trade by Bai Zhang Hong, Director of Animal and Plant Quarentine, Shanghai CIQ.  Mr. Bai told the audience that Australia’s fruit shipments to China have increased by 57 times over the past four years, largely because of the increasing volume of Australian citrus.  He noted that this increase was at least partially driven by consumer demand for the superior flavor and color for which Australian citrus is recognized around the world.    Mr. Bai also described his recent trip to Australia during which he stayed for nearly one month in Madura, one of the largest citrus producing regions, and was highly impressed by the level of care that is given to ensuring the quality, safety, and traceability of Australian fruits exported to China. </p>
<p>Mr. Bai’s remarks were followed by a speech from Sophia Xue, Deputy Director of the China Agricultural Wholesale Markets Association (CAWA).  Ms. Xue described a recent delegation of CAWA members to Australia to visit orange production operations that she felt played an important role in strengthening the citrus trade between Australia and China.  Ms. Xue also mentioned that among her 4,400 wholesale market members, 1,200 were specialized in fresh fruits and vegetables, and that these markets still serve as the primary distribution channel for imported Australian citrus in China.  CAWA will be holding two events this November in Shandong province and Beijing at which Citrus Australia will also take part.</p>
<p>Following Ms. Xue’s speech were presentations from two key figures from Citrus Australia that had traveled all the way to China to attend the event and promote their country’s oranges.<br />
Andrew Harty, General Manager of Market Development, presented an introduction to the Australian citrus sector, and the Sweet, Safe & Healthy message.  Mr. Harty noted that the CAWA delegation was a great success and one of the most important visits from China that the orange industry has received.  He strongly emphasized that the success of Australian citrus in China was not only due to the fruit quality, but also represented the result of years of hard work by the industry to upgrade their orchards, processing, and packing facilities to meet the strict requirements of Chinese inspection authorities.  These efforts reflected the devotion of Citrus Australia to pursuing long-term relationships with Chinese partners, and ensuring the future success of the Australian citrus sector and enjoyment of Australian citrus by Chinese consumers.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mr. Harty explained it is ultimately the unique climatic and geographic circumstances of Australia that allow for the production of such high quality oranges.  Oranges are grown in every state and region in Australia, for which the range of climates from north to south provide a long season, which is counter seasonal to both Chinese and North American orange seasons.  In particular, the clean water and constant sunshine throughout the country contribute to the high sugar content of Australian oranges, while the cold nighttime temperatures give the fruit its deep orange color.  Most Australian citrus farms are small, family run operations approximately 40-100 hectares in size, although there are also some corporate farms as large as 1,600 hectares.</p>
<p>Mr. Harty’s presentation was followed by an introduction to food safety practices in the Australian citrus industry by David Daniels, Market Access Manager of Citrus Australia.  Mr. Daniels explained that integrated pest management (IPM) is used on all Australian orange farms, which is much safer than agrichemicals, and that all consignments are traceable from farm to market.  He also described a food safety program specifically for citrus that was jointly established by Citrus Australia and the Australian government.  In the program’s three year history, over 700 tests have been conducted on Australian citrus, 100 percent of which have achieved compliance with Chinese standards.</p>
<p>The speaker portion of the event concluded with a short presentation by Mr. Harty on the health benefits of eating Australian oranges.  Mr. Harty expressed regret that Western-style junk foods had spread throughout the world and now serve as competition to healthy fruit and vegetable alternatives such as Australian oranges.  Mr. Harty explained several important health aspects of Australian oranges that are particularly desirable to Chinese consumers.  These included high vitamin A and C content, as well as flavonoids which provide antitumor and anti-inflammatory effects.  Fiber from oranges also encourages a healthy bowel and a healthy heart, while folate from oranges is essential for pregnant women to give birth to healthy babies.</p>
<p>Following the presentations, attendees had the chance to taste 9 different dishes that had been prepared by the Four Seasons Hotel executive chef demonstrating the fruit’s diversity in culinary applications.  Media and trade attendees excitedly gathered around the masterfully prepared food displays and took photos with the Citrus Australia kangaroo.<br />
Citrus Australia is the association representing Australia’s citrus industry.  Citrus Australia serves the citrus industry by focusing on public affairs, market access, trade development, production information, industry communication, and biosecurity/plant health.</p>

"Cranberry Mixology Masterclass held in Shanghai","2014-05-25T07:13:15+01:00","https://www.mzmc.com.cn/sites/default/files/field/image/2_0.jpg, https://www.mzmc.com.cn/sites/default/files/field/image/1_0.jpg","Cranberries, Demonstration, Education, Seminar, Training","","/news/cranberry-mixology-masterclass-held-shanghai","On 15 May 2014, Shanghai local and regional bartenders gathered at the bar of one of China's leading beverage publications to learn about U.S. cranberries and their applications in mixology.","<p>On 15 May 2014, Shanghai local and regional bartenders gathered at the bar of one of China's leading beverage publications to learn about U.S. cranberries and their applications in mixology.</p>
<p>The event kicked off with a comprehensive introduction to U.S. cranberry production regions, harvest methods, and health benefits by Scott Soares, Executive Director of the U.S. Cranberry Marketing Committee (CMC).  The approximately 30 attendees were captivated by the unique wet harvest photos and seemingly magical health properties of the berry which is still relatively unknown in China.  Several questions followed Mr. Soares’ presentation:</p>
<p>“Does the wet harvest method negatively impact the fruit quality?”</p>
<p>“What product forms offer the greatest health benefits?”</p>
<p>Mr. Soares explained that the fruit’s internal air chambers allow it to float in the water and that most wet harvest cranberries are used for processing into sweetened dried cranberries, sauce, and juice.  He further explained one of the fruit’s most unique characteristics that its health properties are not diminished by processing or cooking, and showed the audience a table of optimal daily consumption quantities for varies product forms.</p>
<p>The Q&A session was followed by a cranberry cocktail workshop by Mr. Yang, a master mixologist.  Eight innovative cranberry cocktails were demonstrated in four categories ranging in liquor content: mocktail, low alcohol, simple mix, and creative twists on classic cocktails.  After the demonstrations, attendees were invited to taste each of the cocktails, as well as indulge in some cranberry oat bar snacks prepared by Chef Michael Rosenblum, Resident Chef of the U.S. Ambassador to China.</p>
<p>After the masterclass Mr. Yang explained:</p>
<p>""Cranberry is a new product for the China Market.  I came back to Shanghai from the UK in 2010 and saw cranberry juice being used in some bars, however not many bartenders knew what it was.  Now you can find Cranberry products in shops, supermarkets, and many bars and restaurants.  But still, if you ask most bartenders what are cranberries or what a cranberry looks like, most of them still don't have any idea.  I believe that in the near future more and more industry people and consumers will understand cranberry products and enjoy them more.  It is from this perspective that I have created these 8 cranberry drinks for the first U.S. Cranberry Masterclass by CMC and DRiNK magazine in China.""</p>
<p>Based on the level of interested shown, it is expected that many attendees will return to their bars inspired to make their own cranberry cocktails, and more able to educate their colleagues and customers about U.S. cranberries.  Just days after the workshop, the CMC China office had already received an inquiry from one attendee asking where 100% cranberry juice can be sourced in Shanghai.  CMC will be holding two additional U.S. Cranberry Masterclass tours in China in 2014.</p>

<p>2014 marked the second year in which NPGC has hosted a U.S. Pecans booth at the SIAL China trade show.  The U.S. Pecans large corner booth attracted significant attention from attendees who were drawn toward its colorful displays, samples of pecan products, and exciting chef demonstrations.  Based upon visitor reactions, awareness of pecans had increased since the previous year’s exhibition.  Nevertheless, some consumer-visitors were still unaware of pecans, initially mistaking them for walnuts.  NPGC booth staff were on hand to introduce such consumers to pecans, offer various pecan samples, and provide literature on the unique health benefits of pecans.</p>
<p>Throughout the three-day show, the U.S. Pecans booth was also a popular gathering point for major nut importers and food industry professionals that were interested in learning more about pecan varieties, prices, and product forms.  They had the opportunity to speak directly with five pecan growers and exporters that had traveled all the way from various regions of the U.S. to promote their pecans and learn about their target market in China.</p>
<p>Several times during each day of the show, six recipes and two desserts featuring U.S. pecans were demonstrated by the NPGC consulting chef. The chef demonstrations attracted large crowds of Chinese consumers that were dazzled by the dishes’ presentations and intrigued by the creative use of pecans in familiar dishes such as fried rice.</p>
<p>On the second day of the show, the U.S. Pecans booth was visited by Tudou.com, China’s earliest and most influential video sharing website. Interviews were conducted on video with Randy Hudson and Janice Dees of the Georgia Pecan Growers Association, and Keith Schneller, Director of ATO Shanghai.  During the show, Mr. Randy Hudson and Janice Dees held meetings with major nut importers from Zhejiang and Guangzhou, as well as a key association overseeing China's standards for imported nuts.</p>
<p>The 2014 edition of SIAL China represented the show’s 15th year and achieved a record 45,000 professional visitors and 2,400 exhibitors from 90 countries and regions.</p>
<p>On the evening of May 14th, ATO Shanghai hosted a trade reception at the Wyndham hotel for USA pavilion exhibitors at which U.S. Pecans received additional exposure.  In the gathering area outside the reception hall, NPGC hosted a table featuring U.S. Pecans literature and samples which were popular among the USA pavilion exhibitors and VIP Chinese attendees, most of which came from major trading companies, retail chains, and e-commerce websites.</p>

","<p>From 18-20 April 2014, Shanghai’s community of Chinese and expat beer enthusiasts and home brewers flocked to the Brewers Association’s (BA) American craft beer tent at the 3rd Shanghai International Beer Festival (SIBF).  </p>
<p>Featuring 45 beer styles from 13 U.S. craft breweries, the BA tent was one of the largest and most popular at the festival.  During the three-day event, large numbers of visitors were drawn into the tent by the myriad brews and colorful labels, most of which are unavailable in China.  In addition to the constant ebb and flow of new visitors, the BA tent also served as the festival’s meeting point for the newly launched China Home Brewers Association, whose members sampled and discussed nearly all 45 of the different American craft beers offered over the three days.  The tent also served as the festival’s primary hangout for Shanghai local craft beer bar owners and employees, as well as expats that were thrilled to once again have access to their favorite beers.  Throughout the event, BA China representatives were constantly asked “where can I get these beers in China?”  Although many visitors were disappointed to learn that most of the beers are not available in China, the wide variety and exclusivity of the beers on offer at the BA tent served to generate greater interest and demand for American craft beers.</p>
<p>In addition to hosting an American Craft Beer tent, BA’s Bob Pease traveled all the way from Boulder Colorado to attend the festival making his debut as Chief Operating Officer, and serving as a judge in the festival’s beer competition.</p>
<p>Shanghai International Beer Festival has grown rapidly since its launch in 2012 with the 3rd edition having hosted nearly 30,000 visitors, an increase of almost 7,000 from the previous year.  According to the event organizers, returning exhibitors noticed an increase in the number of Chinese visitors, many of which are demonstrating an increasing interest in foreign and locally brewed craft beers.  The success of the event is further demonstrated by the turnout of nearly 12,000 visitors who weathered rain and fog on the second day in order to not miss out on any of the festival.</p>

In particular, several questions were raised about the code prefixes of “8” and “9” which represent GMO and organic products, respectively:</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If a company prefixes a “9” to a PLU code for a product that is not actually organic, what is PMA’s role in responding to this?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The PLU code system is a voluntary industry standard for improving supply chain and retail efficiency.  There are several organic standards by which products may be certified, and it is the responsibility of retailers and traders to verify the legitimacy of organic certifications for the products they provide.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What if a product is GMO, however the “8” prefix is not included on its PLU code?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Firstly, there are relatively few GMO fresh produce items when compared with major staple foods such as grains and beans.  Secondly, the PLU code system is designed for efficient product identification among the trade, not for informing consumers about product characteristics.  As such, PMA does not hold liability for how the codes are used, and it remains the responsibility traders and retailers to verify product authenticity.</p>
<p>Although fresh fruits or vegetables are currently rarely seen with PLU codes in China, its application is expected to increase in coming years.  The presentation was well-received by attendees and served to increase knowledge of the PLU code system among key members of the government and trade.  For fruit and vegetable exporters, applying PLU codes to their products can improve efficiency in trade with countries where the system is widely used.  For government officials, the training will help in answering questions from both traders and consumers as the PLU system becomes increasingly recognized and applied in China.</p>

"First Cranberry Beer Brewed in China: U.S. Cranberries Celebrate Chinese New Year with New Cranberry Beer Launch","2014-01-26T00:00:00+00:00","https://www.mzmc.com.cn/sites/default/files/field/image/XIAL5774.jpg, https://www.mzmc.com.cn/sites/default/files/field/image/XIAL5981.jpg","Beer, Cranberries, Culinary","","/news/first-cranberry-beer-brewed-china-us-cranberries-celebrate-chinese-new-year-new-cranberry-beer","On the evening of January 22 2014, the U.S. Cranberry Marketing Committee (CMC) celebrated the Chinese New Year with the launch of a new cranberry beer by Boxing Cat Brewery in Shanghai, China.","<p>On the evening of January 22 2014, the U.S. Cranberry Marketing Committee (CMC) celebrated the Chinese New Year with the launch of a new cranberry beer by Boxing Cat Brewery in Shanghai, China.</p>
<p>Spanning two floors of the Boxing Cat Brewery flagship Shanghai location, the celebration hosted nearly 100 guests.  More than half of attendees represented CMC China partners that had contributed to the highly successful first year of U.S. cranberry marketing in China.  These included major industry and consumer lifestyle media, importers and distributors, e-commerce websites, and bakeries.  The celebration was also joined by Boxing Cat Brewery’s VIP guests: beer connoisseurs and home brewers that loyally attend Boxing Cat’s beer launch celebrations.</p>
<p>The event kicked off with a speech by Boxing Cat Brewmaster, Michael Jordan, about how the concept for the beer was born and the brewing process.  Attendees sipped their beers as Michael told the story and explained how the ingredients were chosen and combined to create the luxuriously dark yet smooth wintertime brew: Cashmere Cranberry Porter.  Opening remarks were also delivered by Keith Schneller, Director of ATO Shanghai, and a speech by Scott Soares, Executive Director of CMC, was read by Mabel Zhuang, the CMC China consultant.  Michael also recited a poem prepared by Scott especially for the occasion which received a hearty round of applause and to which everyone toasted.</p>
<p>Following the opening remarks, the floor was opened for Q&A about the beer:</p>
<p>“Recently there’s been a lot of press about cranberries as a superfruit.  Is this beer particularly healthy compared to other beers?”</p>
<p>“How did you decide to combine chocolate with cranberries?”</p>
<p>“Are you going to use cranberries again?  In what types of beers?”</p>
<p>During the opening remarks and Q&A session, attendees enjoyed samples of the new brew along with a dish specially created to pair with the beer’s flavors: Crispy Duck Nuggets on Cheese Crisp with Bacon Cranberry Relish.  CMC China invitees also enjoyed a festive holiday meal including several dishes prepared with U.S. cranberries, as the story of the beer and brewing process was retold by Michael with Chinese translation.  Cranberry samples and pamphlets were arranged on every table, and U.S. Cranberry banners were displayed throughout both floors during the celebration.  Both Chinese and expat attendees greatly enjoyed the beer and paired dishes.  Throughout the event, comments from attendee conversations could be overheard complementing the beer’s flavor, color, and smoothness, as well as strongly positive evaluations from home brewers about the difficulties in creating fruit beers and the successful balance achieved in this brew.</p>
<p>Boxing Cat’s Cashmere Cranberry Porter is the first cranberry beer brewed in China, and perhaps the first in Asia.  A shining example of the versatile applications of cranberries, the beer uses dark chocolate imported from Belgium and cranberries from the U.S., combining the cranberry tartness with the chocolate sweetness.  Imported malts used during the brewing process contribute a nice note of caramel and a light roastiness.  The delicate use of hops allows the cranberry and chocolate to shine through the aroma and finishing flavor, giving the smoothness of the beer a similarity to fine liquid cashmere.  It will be a limited release beer, pouring through February at both Boxing Cat Brewery locations.</p>
<p>The beer represents a collaborative effort between Boxing Cat and CMC which utilized the USDA’s Quality Sample Program to provide frozen cranberries and cranberry puree for the beer’s development.  The concept for the beer was born when Scott and Michael were introduced over a casual dinner and the topic of a cranberry beer arose.  It was quickly decided that would be Michael’s next project, and less than one month later, the beer was already brewing.</p>
<p>As the first new cranberry product launched in China in 2014 with the support of CMC, and based on the highly positive atmosphere and reactions from CMC China partners, the event provides great optimism for U.S. Cranberries in China as the Year of the Horse rapidly approaches.</p>

Families gathered around the promotion area to try samples and learn about the origin, culinary applications, and health benefits of the unique American nut.    </p>
<p>Following an overview of American pecans by the U.S. Pecans China consultant, popular food blogger, Yu Fei, demonstrated two healthy pecan recipes that are easily prepared at home:</p>
<p>•	Pecan Yogurt Mousse<br />
•	Pecan Fruit Tart</p>
<p>Ingredients were then distributed to participants who competed to see who could make the best dish following Yu Fei’s guidance.  All participants received pecan gift bags, while those that created the best pecan dishes also received additional prizes.  Participants had more opportunities to win prizes by answering trivia questions about pecan production areas, health benefits, and fun facts such as the origin of the Chinese word for “pecan.”  A total of 38 consumers directly participated the activities, while many more gathered to observe.</p>
<p>Regarding the two recipes, Yu Fei explained:</p>
<p>“I created the Pecan Yogurt Mousse as a breakfast dish.  Because in the morning, when one is in a rush, adding some pecans and fruit to the yogurt not only makes it more healthy, but also gives you more energy.”</p>
<p>“The Pecan Fruit Tart was designed to be served with afternoon tea.  Since all berries have high levels of antioxidants, they are a perfect match for pecans, which have the highest antioxidant level of all nuts.”</p>
<p>In interviews following the activities, several participants said that they had fun and learned a lot at the event, while some also asked when the next class would be held.  Several addition quotes from participants are as follows:</p>
<p>”Before we only at pecans as a snack, but now we will start adding it to other foods as well”</p>
<p>“The two pecan recipes are very inspiring, I will definitely try them at home”</p>
<p>“We also learned that pecans have so many health benefits that are good for my whole family”</p>
<p>With a special focus on expanding consumer awareness of U.S. pecans, the Joy City promotion was jointly held with COFCO Womai, one of China’s leading e-commerce websites for high-end foods and groceries.  COFCO is the largest manufacturer, processor, and trader of agricultural products in China, while Womai.com is an e-commerce website invested by COFCO.  Currently, Womai.com has more than 200 SKUs of imported American products and carries several brands of pecan products.</p>
<p>Prior to the offline promotion, Yu Fei, Womai.com, and Joy City all published posts about the pecan promotion on their official Weibo social media accounts, which have a combined total following of 2.4 million.  Mr. Yu Fei’s Weibo account has 30,684 followers, and he is the author of the newly published book entitled Mobile Kitchen.</p>
<p>During the promotion at Joy City, NPGC and Womai.com displayed and sold U.S. pecan products that are also featured for sale on the womai.com website.  Three brands were offered for sale during the event: Aming, Nongge, and Merveille.  Samples and informational pamphlets were also provided to encourage sales.</p>

The first morning’s activities got underway at the Hilton Beijing Hotel with a combined media workshop and bakery seminar which attracted more than forty traders and twenty media.  Ralph Bean, Director of ATO Beijing, delivered opening remarks, followed by an overview of the U.S. cranberry industry by Scott J. Soares, Executive Director of CMC. A presentation on the many health benefits of U.S. cranberries was delivered by Dr. Amy B. Howell. Dr. Howell, a Rutgers University research scientist with more than 20 years of experience studying cranberry health effects, was recently a part of an international study showing that the bioactive compounds found in cranberries are a rich source of phenolic bioactives with wide-reaching health benefits that cannot be replaced by other berries, dried fruits or juices. </p>
<p>As part of their “cranberry experience,” workshop participants were invited to a unique lunch composed entirely of foods and beverages incorporating U.S. cranberry products.  To further enhance their taste for U.S. cranberries, participants were also treated that afternoon to a demonstration by Michael D. Rosenblum, Executive Chef to the U.S. Ambassador to China, who unveiled five recipes especially created for U.S. Cranberries to showcase the fruit’s versatility.  The chef demonstration was a visual and flavorful feast for the more than twenty local chefs, bakery chains, and retailers in attendance.  Both media and industry representatives reacted extremely positively to the event, many expressing enthusiasm for the berry’s potential as a health food and as a versatile ingredient that can be used to differentiate one’s product offerings.</p>
<p>No sooner had the Beijing event wrapped up, U.S. Cranberries was on its way to Shanghai where it made a big splash as a first-year exhibitor at the 2013 Food and Hotel China (FHC) show in Shanghai from November 13-15.  In its 17th year, the FHC is among the premier food trade shows in China drawing an estimated 30,000 visitors from across China and around the world. The CMC’s U.S. Cranberries large corner booth just inside the entrance to the show, drew attendees visiting the USA pavilion toward the colorful displays, samples of cranberry products, and the opportunity to have their picture taken with a life-size cut-out of “Ms. Cranberry.” Although many visitors to the booth were aware of cranberries, most were unfamiliar with the various product forms and possible applications.  Visitors who had never tried cranberries puckered their lips and squinted at the berry’s unique tart flavor before helping themselves to a second taste.  The overall reaction to the U.S. Cranberries’ booth and number of trade leads generated were far better than expected and indicates a very promising future for U.S. cranberries in China.</p>
<p>On Friday, November 15, Mr. Soares and Dr. Howell served as judges for a cranberry cooking competition held in cooperation with the popular culinary and lifestyle magazine, Betty’s Kitchen, and leading imported food distributor, Sinodis.  The sixteen participants, who were selected from the 80 finalists among 1,000 contest applications, were all food bloggers who had learned about the competition via a Betty’s Kitchen online cranberry recipe contest.  Divided into teams of four, they competed to see which team could make the best scone, muffin, and mousse using U.S. cranberries.  After two hours of culinary action, Mr. Soares and Dr. Howell evaluated the result of each team’s efforts based on appearance, flavor, texture, and technique.  While all participants received a cranberry gift bag, each member of the winning team also received a large bottle of cranberry juice.  In post-event interviews, participants said that they love cooking with cranberries for their unique flavor and color, and that learning about the health benefits encourages them to use cranberries more at home with their families.  Participants also expressed interest in using additional forms of cranberries in their recipes such as frozen, fresh, and cranberry powder.</p>
<p>In addition to the seminar, trade show presence, demonstrations, and baking competition, innumerable meetings and discussions, including visits with FAS Under Secretary Michael Scuse and National Association of State Departments of Agriculture Vermont Agriculture Secretary Chuck Ross, took place during the 5 day trip.  All combined, these experiences served to reinforce the potential that the China market holds for US cranberries!</p>

Written by Michael Rosenblum, CMC China Consulting Chef and Personal Chef to the U.S. Ambassador to China, the October article focuses on applications of frozen cranberries in baking.</p>
<p>Founded in 2006, China Sweets Industry is published by the China Bakery Sugar Industry Association and is mainly targeted at food manufacturers. With a circulation of 10,000 per issue, the publication is the only professional journal for the confectionery industry in China and covers chocolate, candy, ice cream, snack foods, and baking.</p>
<p><strong>Enjoy the full English version of the article below!</strong></p>
<p>Frozen American Cranberries: the Perfect Ingredient for Baked Goods</p>
<p>How many times has a similar situation happened to you? You try a dish somewhere which really intrigues you and you say, ""wow, that was good. But I bet I could make it better if I added 'this' or 'that' ingredient into it."" You like they used a certain ingredient, but you know a better one. Only there is a problem: you can't figure out how to incorporate this better ingredient into your existing recipe. It's a solid, but for the old recipe to work, you need a liquid. Or it's a liquid and a solid is best suited. Recipes can be finicky - changing them even slightly can produce drastically different results. What to do?</p>
<p>In truth, not all ingredients are created equal. All are wonderful. Some are particularly adaptable. Very few are highly universal in their application abilities. But they don't all function the same. Luckily, US cranberries fall into the latter.</p>
<p>US cranberries are available in five different ways: fresh, frozen, as juice, dried and in powdered form. In our previous articles, we have highlighted some of the key features of each briefly. Here I would like to highlight one exceptional US cranberry product, available to the Chinese market with an emphasis on baking application: frozen US cranberries.</p>
<p>As they are likely more familiar, lets begin with frozen US cranberries. Frozen US cranberries are unique not only because they are selected from the best of US cranberries, but because the unique freezing process captures their freshness in such a way that it preserves most of their essential nutrients. This is as close to a fresh cranberry that you can get, though it doesn't exactly behave like a fresh cranberry. Baking a fresh US cranberry will naturally result in some of the moisture from the fruit being released into the product, though not much. This is good when you'd like to maintain the ambient color of the product while still incorporating cranberries in the recipe.</p>
<p>Frozen US cranberries are just te opposite. Freezing any fruit causes changes to the plant's structure. When US cranberries are frozen, the water contained within the cells expands, rupturing the cell walls and causing their beautiful red liquid to become concentrated and more readily available. </p>
<p>When applied to baked goods, such as breads, cakes, batters or even fruit fillings, a lovely color can be achieved. Depending on how deep you would like the color to be, you can add more of less of the frozen US cranberries, or even squeeze the juice from the frozen fruit, separating the liquid from the solid contents. </p>
<p>By using frozen US cranberries, versus dried or US cranberry juice, you can take advantage of their unique solid and liquid characteristics. </p>
<p>This combination of solid and liquid properties can be used in a variety of ways. For example, add frozen US cranberries to chemical-leavened  breads, like muffins or banana-style breads, where you would like to add moistness without incorporating additional liquid. </p>
<p>As frozen US cranberries bake, more of their liquid will be released into the batter than their fresh counterparts, however it's not enough to affect the balance of the recipe. Therefore the product will still be that beautiful rouge that is so attractive to customers, yet not be soggy or waterlogged. </p>
<p>Use them as you would any other internal garnish like nuts or raisins. The majority of the moisture will remain inside the cranberry. That's a good thing, because it means breads and pastries which contain frozen US cranberries will stay moister and tastier without being soft or doughy. </p>
<p>Frozen US cranberries are also great because they house the rich and concentrated cranberry flavor in the liquid, while still offering texture and body that is characteristic of the fresh fruit. So they integrate seamlessly in jams and purées, as well as sauces, smoothies and other dessert bases. They can even be sugared or mixed with other flavors and refrozen, or added to ice creams and sorbets. You could also use them as you would Chinese goji berries, infusing them in liquor for both their taste and their wonderful health benefits. </p>
<p>Frozen US cranberries may not be as familiar as dried cranberries or cranberry juice, but make no mistake in their versatility. If you can think it, you can do it. The limits in using US cranberries are only your imagination.</p>
<p>And for all the folks out there who have begun integrating more savory items to their bakery menus, consider this: next time you're looking to add a little something special to your everyday roast chicken sandwich, think US cranberry!</p>

Entitled <em>US Cranberries – Rustic Equals Profit</em>, the article was written by Michael D. Rosenblum, CMC China Consulting Chef and Chef of the U.S. Ambassador to China.  Eloquently describing America’s renewed interest in rustic foods, the article explores two case studies regarding how this trend has been capitalized upon by the baking industry: first by international coffee giant, Starbucks; second by Balthazar Bakery, the premier artisanal trend-setting bakery/eatery in New York City.</p>
<p>Founded in 2006, China Sweets Industry is published by the China Bakery Sugar Industry Association and is mainly targeted at food manufacturers. With a circulation of 10,000 per issue, the publication is the only professional journal for the confectionery industry in China and covers chocolate, candy, ice cream, snack foods, and baking.</p>
<p><strong>Below is the full-text English version.  Enjoy!</strong></p>
<p>In recent years, the American baking industry has undergone something of a repositioning relative to key ingredients and techniques used to capture consumer interest and market share. Home cooking, baking and confectionery are enjoying renewed favor with a cross section of the American population, transcending social and economic factors. People have fallen back in-love with cooking, and the commercial baking industry is changing to meet a new kind of demand. Frilly, overly complicated pastries and confections, the kind that smack of artificial ingredients and machine processing, have fallen out of favor. There has been renewed interest in the handmade, artisanal product where small imperfections are seen as positive aspects of an item's individual character; and the character of the chef who made it. By hand.</p>
<p>Consumers these days are demanding more of a connection with their food. Food is better when it tells a story, when it reminds us of memories filled with warm family kitchens and loved ones. If a style, or phrase, could be associated with this trend, it is rustic.</p>
<p>Rustic in essence means that something is hand-crafted, where flavor is considered tantamount to all other attributes - including appearance. Where high-end pastry and confectionery speak of classic European uniformity, reminiscent of leisurely bourgeois dining tables with each item looking identical, rustic baked goods are desirable specifically because they are all a little different. Chopping of fillings or toppings and portioning and shaping of breads or Viennoisserie done by hand is seen as less precise than that accomplished by machine. When these tasks are accomplished by hand, there is often subtle variation in texture and size. These inconsistencies are desirable, appealing to the psychology that the said item was homemade. Most Americans these days would agree that ""homemade is better"". Not necessarily because of superior flavor or even quality, but because good taste coupled with emotional attachment to memory or preference amounts to a greater overall experience. As such, many chain bakeries have begun paying particular attention to not doing things so particularly. Subtle differences, the kind found in rustic desserts, is good. Different is special. Different means profit.</p>
<p>But this trend has extended beyond visual appeal and into the realm of flavor. In keeping with the theme of rustic, delicate flavors and pricy exotic tastes have waned. In their place, we find humble, familiar ingredients from our past. Frilly ""classical"" preparations, like gently poached French pears in Armagnac, are out. In their stead, bold and rustic desserts have found a home. Slow roasted local apple and cranberry cobbler, whispering of the farmer-neighbor whose name your grandfather once knew, of days before mega-stores replaced hand-picked baskets of produce along the roadside, is in. In America, few fruits have seen such sudden and rediscovered attention as the cranberry. To better understand the above mentioned trends, we look to two of America's baking industry leaders at different sides of the industry, observing how they have employed the use of the amazingly versatile fruit to appeal to America's sense of nostalgia as well as their sense of taste. Here we will consider two polar examples of baking industry leaders who had employed the use of US cranberries to appeal to the American consumer's new found interest in all foods rustic.</p>
<p>We begin with international coffee giant Starbucks' use of cranberries in the Cranberry Bliss Bar. The bar begins with a traditional shortbread. It's that most rustic of cookies, with roots in the British isles, a shortbread is little more than bake butter and flour sweetened and flavored. Since times past, it has graced all manner of table; from the humble cupboards of farmers and sheep herders to the high teas enjoyed by England's elite. Despite a modem interpretation which leans toward a more elegant delivery, shortbread is adaptable. Sift your flour and gently cream and shape the final biscuit, and you have a refined sweet worthy of a place in Manhattan's finest patisseries. But drizzle it casually with cream cheese frosting and sprinkle some roughly chopped cranberries over the top, as Starbucks has done, and suddenly the dish is unmistakably rustic. It speaks to you, ""don't be fooled by my homely appearance. I may look pedestrian, but I taste better than any of those fancy shortbreads in more expensive stores."" </p>
<p>This deliberately humble method serves to remind that flavor was given priority over presentation, and possibly more importantly that the dessert is something to be savored anytime, regardless of the occasion. This strategy has proven as effective as it is obvious. Take something people know and love and dress it down. Focus less on making the dish appear ""perfect"" and more on making it look delicious. Rustic preparation, where flavor and taste are the perceived focus, is designed not to impress but to comfort. Cranberries, with their brilliant red color and unique flavor, are capable of both. The Cranberry Bliss Bar's aim is to remind customers of cold winter days warmed by a homemade cookie. Starbucks has done exceedingly well at marketing this pastry to be all about comfort, appealing to the American consumer's sense of holiday nostalgia - a fact that the repeated appearance of Bliss Bars at Starbucks stores every holiday seasons clearly supports.</p>
<p>Next, we look to Balthazar Bakery, the premier artisanal trend-setting bakery/eatery in New York City. Balthazar has, since its inception, been paving the way for other hand-made and artisan-focused American bakeries with their fearless passion for taking rustic, old-world dishes and making them fashionable. In their nationally recognized Cranberry ""clafoutis"", a slightly different approach is taken with cranberries. Here, rather than employ cranberries to dress-down a pastry preparation, they are collectively elevated to something elegant and worthy of a jacket-required dinner reservation in Manhattan. The classic French clafoutis, a refined country-French dessert of dark cherries baked in sweet custard, Balthazar chooses to substitutes fresh cranberries. Switching out fruit alone probably wouldn't take this dessert from typical to extraordinary, which is why the dish has been slightly redesigned as a single serving in a sweet tart crust. Now the naturally rustic flavor and appearance of a dessert which utilizes whole fruits, versus less rustic processed fruit or fruit products, has the added value of being individually garnished with flowers and herbs or other sweet adornments. The end result is a happy marriage between the rustic nature of baked whole fruit, and the elegant appearance of a classic dessert in which care and attention have not been spared to make attractive. Balthazar chose a mix of tradition and innovation by topping the clafoutis with the traditional scoop of ice cream and the not so traditional addition of micro greens.</p>
<p>America's rediscovered passion for rustic comfort foods, and the corresponding industry trends which have followed, remind us that sometimes simple is better, and natural, casual desserts can be elegant and worthy of our admiration. There are many ways to achieve this rustic quality in your own bakery or patisserie, with US cranberries being an exceptionally versatile ingredient not to be overlooked. With a little imagination and the confidence to experiment, who knows? Like Starbucks and Balthazar, your shop's next best seller just might be cranberry-inspired as well.</p>

<p><strong>The following is the English version of the article</strong>:<br /><cite><br />
Americans once thought of cranberries simply as a holiday condiment, necessary as part of the traditional buffet. But today, US cranberries in all their forms, find themselves in renewed favor; whether for their brilliant crimson color or the perfect sweet-sour balance of their flavor, these ruby gems have become an indispensable component in all forms of American cooking.</cite></p>
<p>US Cranberries are truly one of the culinary world's most versatile creations. And America's chefs have gone far beyond Thanksgiving condiments when it comes to being inventive. Cranberries can be prepared a multitude of ways and match wonderfully with almost everything from lamb chops to bitter chocolate. They can be enjoyed alone as a nutritious snack, or employed in your favorite recipe to add that extra something special. Its of little wonder their popularity has increased among American chef's and bakers. Here's a few more reasons why:</p>
<p>You may have heard that US cranberries are one of mother nature's richest sources of polyphenols. But these amazing little fruits are valued by health-conscious individuals beyond their status as antioxidant powerhouses. They work well as a sweet compact fuel source and are frequently added to nutritional bars and supplements as a natural source of vitamins, minerals and energy. It's doesn't stop there. They work just as well in trail mix, granola, scones, muffins and rustic breads. For a truly unique treat, roast fresh cranberries with some lemon or orange peels and roll them through a little fine sugar. Serve them as a lite dessert after a special meal, or as a cake or ice cream topper.</p>
<p>Ever had a dried US cranberry? The sweet little surprises will add texture and flavor to breads and confections. Still, they do far more than garnish; they can elevate the average pastry to a higher level. If you are looking to add some visual appeal to your bakery case, or offer your guests a little something different with regard to flavor pairing, cranberries are an option worth exploring. They lend a flavor unlike any other fruit. What's more, both their sweet-fruity essence and vibrant red hue of US cranberries is intensified when they are cooked. Pair them with any herbs, spices, extracts, nuts or fruits and vegetables of your choosing. It's hard to go wrong. </p>
<p>Perhaps you did not know that US cranberries go far beyond the fresh version. They can be easily found in frozen and dried forms. Both fold effortlessly into batters, stew beautifully into sauces and purées and set like magic without the use of added binders or gelling mediums. What's more, natural juices from the frozen berries lend a brilliant rouge to your favorite dishes - and all without artificial colors. Cranberry sauce makes an excellent decoration for whole cakes or plated desserts, finding harmony from deep dish apple pie to New York Cheesecake and everything in between.</p>
<p>Speaking of juice, if cocktails are your passion, why not brighten up your spirit of choice with a splash of cranberry juice? Naturally sweet, cranberry juice adds a subtle pucker to cocktails, spritzers and blended spirits. For an unusual garnish, drop a few slices of fresh or frozen cranberries into the glass. </p>
<p>Most folks are already aware that eating more fruits and vegetables is a good thing. US cranberries are an easy way to get more fruit into your diet. Light weight and easy to slip into your purse or briefcase, cranberries are an easy choice for busy people on the go. </p>
<p>Whether cooking, baking, mixing drinks or snacking by the handful, US cranberries are a healthy and delicious way to enjoy a real taste of America- one delectable bite at a time.<br /></p>
