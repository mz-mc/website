  From December 4-5 2013, CMC China representatives attended the Worlds of Healthy Flavors Asia conference in Singapore in order to oversee event sponsorship, and explore potential regional partnerships that may gain greater exposure for U.S. cranberries.
  As one of three bronze-level sponsors, CMC hosted a table during the opening reception which featured U.S. cranberry literature, dried cranberry samples, and two dishes using frozen U.S. cranberries prepared from recipes created by Michael Rosenblum, Executive Chef of the U.S. Ambassador to China:

<p>From December 4-5 2013, CMC China representatives attended the Worlds of Healthy Flavors Asia conference in Singapore in order to oversee event sponsorship, and explore potential regional partnerships that may gain greater exposure for U.S. cranberries.</p>
<p>As one of three bronze-level sponsors, CMC hosted a table during the opening reception which featured U.S. cranberry literature, dried cranberry samples, and two dishes using frozen U.S. cranberries prepared from recipes created by Michael Rosenblum, Executive Chef of the U.S. Ambassador to China:</p>
<p>•	Cranberry Rubbed Chicken Panini with Cran-Rosemary Aioli<br />
•	Cranberry Country Bread</p>
<p>Both cranberry dishes were extremely popular and attracted a lot of attention to the CMC table.</p>
<p>After the opening reception, the main event kicked off with lectures and panel discussions covering ten key points about healthy cooking.  Between presentations, top chefs from around the world gave demonstrations on how such knowledge could be applied in the kitchen to make healthier recipes without compromising on flavor.  During breaks throughout the conference, attendees were able to taste each of the recipes demonstrated on stage.  The Cranberry Country Bread featured at the opening reception was skillfully demonstrated by accomplished pastry chef Mr. Robert Jorin.</p>
<p>Organized by the Culinary Institute of America (CIA) and the Harvard School for Public Health, the event featured speakers from academia as well as top chefs from the culinary world and leaders in the food service industry.  The unique conference format seamlessly combined in-depth research about important health issues affected by diet, innovative methods through which such knowledge can be applied in the kitchen, and what it all means from a business and consumer standpoint.  The highly targeted audience of approximately 150 attendees came from the nutrition, institutional catering, food manufacturing, and restaurant sectors, as well as related government and industry associations.  </p>
<p>CIA representatives were very supportive of CMC’s sponsorship and expressed keen interest in exploring opportunities to conduct similar events in China.  Several CIA chefs were also enthusiastic about finding ways to partner with CMC.</p>
