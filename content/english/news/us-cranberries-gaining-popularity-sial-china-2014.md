description: From 13-15 May 2014, U.S. Cranberries made a splash as a first year exhibitor
  at the 2014 SIAL trade show in Shanghai, China.  The U.S. Cranberry Marketing Committee’s
  (CMC) corner booth drew attendees visiting the USA pavilion toward its colorful
  displays, samples of cranberry products, and the opportunity to have their picture
  taken with a life-size cut-out of “Ms. Cranberry.”  Compared with the 2013 FHC show,
  more SIAL visitors were aware of cranberries, however most were still unfamiliar
  with the various product forms and possible applications.
