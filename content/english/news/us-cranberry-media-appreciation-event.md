This cranberry ale has beenavailable on tap at all three of BCB’s outlets in Shanghai and promise to be a popular seasonal beer throughout the summer months.</p>
<p>Eddy Yang, master mixologist, gave the audience a detailedintroduction into mixology applications for cranberries in various product forms including juices, cocktail mixers, frozen, and dried cranberries. Eddy demonstrated these applications by preparing 4 different types of cocktails: alcohol-free, low alcohol, classic cocktails, and unique cocktail creations.Members of the media were impressed by the versatility of cranberries and how they could be mixed with all kinds of different drinks. One member of the media was even invited from the audience to try makinga cranberry Cosmopolitan by herself.
