### Wealth of Experience

MZMC represents food and agriculture industry associations entering or expanding their presence in China.

Country- and region-branded marketing campaigns have proven highly successful in China for raising consumer awareness and increasing trade. Chinese regulators also often require trade issues to be addressed by national-level industry representatives following strict protocols. We have specialized expertise in building strong country brands recognized throughout China, as well as developing and maintaining collaborative relationships with regulators that foster favorable policies and harmonized standards for our clients.

#### Trade missions

Trade missions are often an integral component of successful marketing strategy allowing our clients to better understand their target market while allowing potential buyers to learn about our clients' products. MZMC has extensive experience arranging and leading trade missions between to and from China.
