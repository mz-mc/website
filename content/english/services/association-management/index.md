### Association and Trade Representation

MZMC partners with industry associations and trade bodies to establish and expand their presence in China.

Country- and region-branded programs have consistently proven effective in building consumer recognition, strengthening category demand, and supporting member companies in-market. At the same time, China’s regulatory environment often requires engagement through national-level industry representation conducted according to formal protocols. We bring specialized expertise in developing country platforms that are recognized across the market, while building constructive, long-term relationships with regulatory authorities that support market access, standards alignment, and sustainable growth.

#### Trade missions

Trade missions are often an integral component of successful marketing strategy allowing our clients to better understand their target market while allowing potential buyers to learn about our clients' products. MZMC has extensive experience arranging and leading trade missions between to and from China. We are able to manage all aspects of trade missions including the development of complete itineraries, identifying companies to visit, arranging meetings, providing translators, and assisting in obtaining visas.

#### Trade shows

Exhibiting at trade shows is essential to raising awareness of our clients' products or industry in China. We not only make sure that our clients exhibit at the right trade shows, but also assist with all aspects of the exhibit including booth reservation, staffing, and post-event evaluation and follow-up.
