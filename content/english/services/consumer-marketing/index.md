#### Consumer Marketing

In-store and foodservice promotions remain foundational to food and beverage marketing in China, but they now operate within a fully integrated retail ecosystem shaped by e-commerce, rapid delivery, and social commerce.

We design campaigns that move seamlessly across online and offline environments — from platform-driven activations and content-led engagement to gamified promotions and regionally targeted retail programs. Executing effectively in this landscape requires not only technical expertise, but established working relationships with key retail, e-commerce, and digital platform partners.

#### Trade Promotion

Sustainable market growth depends on capable local partners. We equip importers, distributors, retailers, and foodservice operators with the knowledge, tools, and motivation to execute their own high-quality promotional programs.

Our work includes technical training, category education, and joint market development initiatives, as well as international trade delegations that deepen market understanding and build the relationships that underpin long-term commercial success.
