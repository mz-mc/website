### Progress at the highest levels

MZMC assists food and agriculture producers from around the globe to build collaborative, win-win relationships with Chinese regulators.

Mutual trust and understanding is the most effective way to clear regulatory hurdles and safeguard trade flows. In China, strong government relationships are built over time by demonstrating respect, flexibility, and good will. We keep our finger on the pulse of regulatory developments and enforecment trends that may affect our clients' business. We work with government officials to harmonize Chinese import and labeling requirements with foreign product standards.
