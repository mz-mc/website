### Build It to Last

MZMC helps international clients protect and strengthen their intellectual property position in China — preventing disputes where possible and resolving them effectively when they arise.

China’s first-to-file trademark system and evolving plant variety protection framework create structural risk for overseas organizations. Securing rights early, aligning IP strategy with commercial timelines, and working with experienced in-market partners are essential to avoiding costly disruption and maintaining long-term brand control.

We support clients at every stage, from initial filings to enforcement and dispute resolution. Even where challenges already exist, a structured and well-managed approach can restore control and enable sustainable market development.
