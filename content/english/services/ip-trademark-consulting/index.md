### Build it to last

MZMC helps international clients prevent and resolve intellectual property disputes in China.

Protecting trademarks and intellectual property rights remains one of the primary challenges for overseas businesses and organizations. China’s trademark registration system operates on a first-to-file rather than a first-to-use basis and does not require intent to use by the registrant. This incentivizes blanket filings by unscrupulous parties who then “squat” on the trademark hoping to cash in when the brand moves to formally enter the market.

Although failing to register a trademark in China sufficiently early can lead to additional legal hassles and costs, such challenges are often remediable.

Check the status of trademark filings for your brand on the website of China’s [Trademark Office of National Intellectual Property Administration](http://wcjs.sbj.cnipa.gov.cn/txnT01.do).
