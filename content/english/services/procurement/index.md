### Transparency & Accountability

MZMC managages the procurement of professional services for clients requiring the highest levels of transparency and accountability.

Relationships are foundational to successful businesses around the globe. But sometimes, relationships can interfere with objective, merit-based sourcing of goods and services. This is especially important for government agencies and business entities utilizing public funding, who need to follow strict protocols for competitive bidding and related record keeping. Such challenges can compound when tasked with carrying out high-value procurement activities in foreign markets.

Our procurement management services are based upon standards and protocols used by the USDA and UNOPS, ensuring complete transparency and verifiable fairness.
