#### How we do it

Our research services employ quantitative and qualitative analyses informed by desk research, expert interviews, and field visits to critical points in the supply chain. We use manual search and tech-enabled tools to extract metrics for products, prices, and sellers from popular e-commerce platforms. We identify and interview leading importers, distributors, retailers, industry associations, and government regulators. We conduct field visits to border ports, free trade zones, logistics hubs, retailers, and foodservice outlets. We work with global leaders in consumer survey research to understand the habits and preferences of China's consumers relevant to specific products.
