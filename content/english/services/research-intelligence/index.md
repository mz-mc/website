### Knowledge Is Power

MZMC delivers in-depth research and market intelligence to support evidence-based strategy, KPI tracking, and performance optimization.

We combine long-standing knowledge of China’s food and agriculture landscape with rigorous, field-tested research methodologies and a commitment to understanding how markets function in practice. The result is clearer decision-making, stronger returns on investment, and strategies built for long-term success.

#### How We Work

Our specialists integrate quantitative and qualitative analysis, combining structured desk research with expert interviews and on-the-ground fieldwork at critical points in the value chain.

We extract product, pricing, and seller data from major e-commerce platforms using a hybrid methodology that blends manual validation with advanced analytical tools. We engage directly with importers, distributors, retailers, industry associations, and regulators to test assumptions and verify market realities.

Our field research spans border ports, free-trade zones, logistics hubs, retail environments, and foodservice channels. In parallel, we collaborate with leading global consumer research firms to generate statistically robust insights into purchasing behavior and product perception in China.
