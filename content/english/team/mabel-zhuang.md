  promotion, and association management. Since 1997, she has worked exclusively
  in the food, agriculture, and forestry product sectors, helping globally
  recognized brands and industry associations overcome challenges and seize
  opportunities in the China market. After five years of service with the US

  years consulting for USDA partners before launching MZMC in 2005. Since then,
  she has worked for a number of industry associations from the United States
  and around the world. Mabel has played an instrumental role in introducing
  China's 1.4-billion-strong population to products previously never seen or
  tasted in the country, and she continues to help exporters navigate China's
  complex and increasingly competitive imported food market landscape.

In 2014, Mabel launched a leading Chinese-language produce media outlet named Produce Report and its English-language version was launched in 2016.
