        Since 2005, MZMC has built partnerships that move markets.

        MZMC is a China-focused market development firm with deep expertise in food and agriculture. Our work operates at the intersection of government, industry, and trade — where policy, commerce, and reputation converge.

        We design and execute integrated market development strategies that expand access, stimulate demand, and deliver measurable commercial outcomes. Our capabilities span strategic marketing, applied research, public relations, trade program management, journalism, diplomatic engagement, and policy analysis.

        What differentiates MZMC is not only sector expertise, but execution depth. Our multilingual, multidisciplinary team works fluently across cultural, commercial, and regulatory environments — ensuring strategy translates into results on the ground.

        MZMC is also the only China market development firm of its kind with an integrated media platform: [Produce Report](/produce-report), our industry-recognized digital publication covering China’s fresh produce and agri-food sectors. This direct media capability strengthens our market intelligence, communications precision, and industry reach in ways traditional agencies cannot replicate.

        MZMC is a diverse team of market development specialists — marketers, researchers, and journalists working alongside entrepreneurs, scientists, and artists. This breadth of perspective is intentional. It allows us to approach complex market challenges with both analytical rigor and creative range.

        MZMC was founded by [Mabel Zhuang](/team/mabel-zhuang) after more than a decade in trade promotion and association management, including five years with the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service. She established the firm to meet critical industry needs while building an organization shaped by a clear set of values: using business as a platform to support a fairer, healthier, and more connected world.

        Originally launched as MZ Marketing Communications, MZMC has evolved into a fully integrated market development firm. While our headquarters remain in Shanghai, our team now spans Asia, Europe, and the Americas, supported by an extended global network with reach across six continents.

      title : "How We Deliver Market Outcomes"
      content : |-
        We help international partners build long-term, sustainable businesses in China.

        MZMC advises national associations, government agencies, and companies of all sizes, from SMEs to multinational industry leaders, across the full trade development cycle. Our market research is conducted on the ground, where policy, supply chains, and consumer behavior intersect — identifying bottlenecks, validating assumptions, and uncovering untapped opportunity.

        We design and deliver trade initiatives that set industry benchmarks, from high-level delegations to flagship events that convene the right stakeholders and convert engagement into commercial momentum. Our marketing programs are built not only to raise visibility, but to shape preference, influence purchasing behavior, and establish enduring market presence.

        See selected examples in our [Case Studies](/case-studies).

      title : "Why This Work Matters"
      content : |-
        We believe that international trade, when built on trust and shared purpose, can contribute to a healthier, more connected world.

        For us, this means embedding integrity, long-term thinking, and a commitment to excellence in every engagement. Cross-border business is often shaped by misaligned incentives, short time horizons, and information gaps. Our role is to align stakeholders, establish confidence, and create the conditions for durable cooperation and sustainable growth.

        We measure success not only by commercial outcomes, but by the strength of the partnerships we help build. Many of our client relationships evolve into long-term collaborations grounded in mutual respect and shared achievement. We approach each engagement with the conviction that business, at its best, is a platform for meaningful cooperation — and for delivering results that endure.
