      <br><br>
      MZMC was founded by [Mabel Zhuang](/team/mabel-zhuang). After 13 years of working in trade promotion and association management — including serving for five years with the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service — she decided to use her skills and resources to build a company that would meet critical industry needs while reflecting her vision and values: using business as a platform to support a fairer, healthier, and more connected world. Originally MZ Marketing Communications, MZMC is now much more than a marketing communications firm. While our company headquarters remains in Shanghai, our global experts span Asia, Europe, and the Americas, with an extended network covering six continents.

      title : "Because we care"
      content : "We’re passionate about food and agriculture and believe in the possibility of a better world — one in which everyone can coexist in health and harmony.
      <br><br>
      In practice, that means building integrity, trust, and excellence into everything we do. We like to think of MZMC as a little oasis in the midst of a chaotic world of international business often characterized by distrust, short-term aims, and mismatched priorities. MZMC is different. We take pride in what we do and how well we do it. Our clients often become our friends. For us, business is a platform for cooperation with the potential to bring out our best — and that is how we approach all of our partnerships."
